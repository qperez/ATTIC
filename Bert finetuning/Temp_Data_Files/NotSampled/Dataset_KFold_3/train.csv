0,"RangeQuery and RangeFilter should use collation to check for range inclusionSee [this java-user discussion|http://www.nabble.com/lucene-farsi-problem-td16977096.html] of problems caused by Unicode code-point comparison, instead of collation, in RangeQuery.

RangeQuery could take in a Locale via a setter, which could be used with a java.text.Collator and/or CollationKey's, to handle ranges for languages which have alphabet orderings different from those in Unicode."
1,"NodeReferences are lost when deleting and setting the same reference in the same save() cycleI've written the following snippet to illustrate the issue :

        Node root = session.getRootNode();
        
        Node a = root.addNode(""a"");
        Node b = root.addNode(""b"");
        b.addMixin(""mix:referenceable"");
        
        a.setProperty(""p"", b);
        
        root.save();
        
        System.out.println(b.getReferences().getSize());     // --> correctly returns 1
        
        a.setProperty(""p"", (Node) null);
        a.setProperty(""p"", b);
        
        root.save();
        
        System.out.println(b.getReferences().getSize());    // --> returns 0 !

When the ChangeLog is processed, added references are processed before deleted ones, so the persisted NodeReferences is finally wrong.

I've set the priority of this issue to critical, because the persisted references count is corrupted.

A simple workaround is to first remove the property, then save, then add the property again, but it not satisfying.

0,"Missing class JNDIDatabaseJournalWe're dealing to set up a clustered repository and run into some issues and missing features stated to be fixed in the upcoming v1.4. But while scanning the sources of the v1.4-rc1, i still can't find the class

  JNDIDatabaseJournal (org.apache.jackrabbit.core.journal.JNDIDatabaseJournal)

as a silbing to the classes 

  JNDIDatabaseFileSystem (org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.db.JNDIDatabaseFileSystem)

and 

  JNDIDatabasePersistenceManager (org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.db.JNDIDatabasePersistenceManager)

The missing one you'll need to configure all parts of a repository handeled in an abstract way by (e.g one common) JNDI database resource. From the shortness and simplicity of the source code of the other ones, i think adding this missing feature takes just about an hour.

0,"bulk postings should be codec privateIn LUCENE-2723, a lot of work was done to speed up Lucene's bulk postings read API.

There were some upsides:
* you could specify things like 'i dont care about frequency data up front'.
  This made things like multitermquery->filter and other consumers that don't
  care about freqs faster. But this is unrelated to 'bulkness' and we have a
  separate patch now for this on LUCENE-2929.
* the buffersize for standardcodec was increased to 128, increasing performance
  for TermQueries, but this was unrelated too.

But there were serious downsides/nocommits:
* the API was hairy because it tried to be 'one-size-fits-all'. This made consumer code crazy.
* the API could not really be specialized to your codec: e.g. could never take advantage that e.g. docs and freqs are aligned.
* the API forced codecs to implement delta encoding for things like documents and positions. 
  But this is totally up to the codec how it wants to encode! Some codecs might not use delta encoding.
* using such an API for positions was only theoretical, it would have been super complicated and I doubt ever
  performant or maintainable.
* there was a regression with advance(), probably because the api forced you to do both a linear scan thru
  the remaining buffer, then refill...

I think a cleaner approach is to let codecs do whatever they want to implement the DISI
contract. This lets codecs have the freedom to implement whatever compression/buffering they want
for the best performance, and keeps consumers simple. If a codec uses delta encoding, or if it wants
to defer this to the last possible minute or do it at decode time, thats its own business. Maybe a codec
doesn't want to do any buffering at all.

0,"Order of stored Fields not maintainedAs noted in these threads...

http://www.nabble.com/Order-of-fields-returned-by-Document.getFields%28%29-to21034652.html
http://www.nabble.com/Order-of-fields-within-a-Document-in-Lucene-2.4%2B-to24210597.html

somewhere prior to Lucene 2.4.1 a change was introduced that prevents the Stored fields of a Document from being returned in same order that they were originally added in.  This can cause serious performance problems for people attempting to use LoadFirstFieldSelector or a custom FieldSelector with the LOAD_AND_BREAK, or the SIZE_AND_BREAK options (since the fields don't come back in the order they expect)

Speculation in the email threads is that the origin of this bug is code introduced by LUCENE-1301 -- but the purpose of that issue was refactoring, so if it really is the cause of the change this would seem to be a bug, and not a side affect of a conscious implementation change.

Someone who understands indexing internals should investigate this.  At a minimum, if it's decided that this is not actual a bug, then prior to resolving this bug the wiki docs and some of the FIeldSelector javadocs should be updated to make it clear what order Fields will be returned in.

1,"NodeTypeDef depends on supertype orderingCurrently the NodeTypeDef.setSupertypes() method simply sets the given QName array as the supertype QName array of the defined node type, thus preserving whatever ordering a node type parser or ultimately a node type definition file uses. This causes problems for example in the equals() method that uses the order-sensitive Arrays.equals() method to check for equality of the supertype QName arrays. The current implementation does therefore not consider the node type definitions ""A > B, C"" and ""A > C, B"" as equal even though they really should be so considered.

The same problem affects also child node and property definitions. The proper fix for this issue would probably be to use Sets to store and handle this information."
0,"REFERENCE properties produce duplicate strings in memoryWhen reference property is loaded from PM, Serializer.deserialize(NodeReferences, InputStream) is called, which calls PropertyId.valueOf(String), which in turn calls NameFactoryImpl.create(String) which finally splits a full property name to namespace and local name. Namespace is internalized, but local name is not (comments say that this is done to avoid perm space overfilling).
So, in the end, a new String instance is created for local name. This leads to considerable memory waste when repository has a lot of nodes with REFERENCE properties.
It seems that local name part could be internalized here too because in the most repositories it's not allowed to create properties with arbitrary names, so the danger of perm space exhaust does not seem to be an argument.

As for ways to resolve this, maybe a new NameFactory implementation could be created which would be used for properties only (and, possibly, mainly in the PropertyId.valueOf(String)) which would extend an existing NameFactoryImpl overriding its create(String) method.

0,"JackrabbitParser and tika 0.7 parserHi,

I was trying to implement a custom parser and found the following problem.
Since tika 0.7 it is possible to implement your custom parser and specify it into a service provider configuration file (META-INF/services/org.apache.tika.parser.Parser). In this way there would be no need to maintain a custom tika-config.xml file if you'd like to implement a custom parser.

The problem that I had was in the JackrabbitParser because I wasn't able to instantiate the AutoDetectParser with the default constructor is will be instantiated using the default TikaConfig constructor.
Basically from tika 0.7, the TikaConfig.getTikaConfig() is instantiating the TikaConfig using the default constructor instead of accessing the tika-config.xml file from withing the package, and reads the service provider configuration files and populate the parsers map.

What I'm proposing is to change the JackrabbitParser to instantiate the AutoDetectParser using the default constructor, in this way the using tika version >= 0.7 we could easily implement our own parsers and there won't be a reason to maintain the tika-config.xml, also a sort of ""backward"" compatibility would be maintained because using the AutoDetectParser default constructor the TikaConfig is instantiated using TikaConfig.getTikaConfig() wich for tika versions < 0.7 calls the TikaConfig(InputStream) constructor whcih reads the configuration directly from the package.

Basically the JackrabbitParser should look like this:

    public JackrabbitParser() {
            	parser = new AutoDetectParser();
    }
 
Thanks,
Dan"

0,"PropertyImpl.getNode() and NamePropertyTest use different exception than documented in the JCR API JavaDocThe Property.getNode() method's JavaDoc [1] lists 3 types of exceptions: ValueFormatException, ItemNotFoundException, and RepositoryException, and that ItemNotFoundException is to be thrown when the target node could not be found.  However, the NamePropertyTest.testGetProperty() method is checking for a PathNotFoundException rather than the documented ItemNotFoundException (see [2], line 189).  Jackrabbit's implementation in PropertyImpl (see [3] line 539) delegates to Session.getNode(absolutePath) or Property.getParent().getNode(relativePath), and these methods are documented as throwing PathNotFoundException (see [4] and [5]).

Therefore, the unit test and PropertyImpl.getNode() implementation appear to be in disagreement with the JCR 2.0 API JavaDoc.

Here's my response on that thread:

The bug only happens when you call addIndexesNoOptimize, and one
simple workaround would be to use SerialMergeScheduler.

I think this is already fixed in trunk (soonish to be 2.4) as a side
effect of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1335.

In 2.3, merges that involve external segments (which are segments
folded in by addIndexesNoOptimize) are not supposed to run in a BG
thread.  This is to prevent addIndexesNoOptimize from returning until
after all external segments have been carried over (merged or copied)
into the index, so that if there is an exception (eg disk full),
addIndexesNoOptimize is able to rollback to the index to the starting
point.

The primary merge() method of CMS indeed does not BG any external
merges, but the bug is that when a BG merge finishes it then selects a
new merge to kick off and that selection is happy to pick an external
segment."

1,"FieldCache.getStringIndex should not throw exception if term count exceeds doc countSpinoff of LUCENE-2133/LUCENE-831.

Currently FieldCache cannot handle more than one value per field.
We may someday want to fix that... but until that day:

FieldCache.getStringIndex currently does a simplistic check to try to
catch when you've accidentally allowed more than one term per field,
by testing if the number of unique terms exceeds the number of
documents.

The problem is, this is not a perfect check, in that it allows false
negatives (you could have more than one term per field for some docs
and the check won't catch you).

Further, the exception thrown is the unchecked RuntimeException.

So this means... you could happily think all is good, until some day,
well into production, once you've updated enough docs, suddenly the
check will catch you and throw an unhandled exception, stopping all
searches [that need to sort by this string field] in their tracks.
It's not gracefully degrading.

I think we should simply remove the test, ie, if you have more terms
than docs then the terms simply overwrite one another.

- Collapse the logic of ReusableAnalyzerBase into Analyzer
- Add a ReuseStrategy abstraction to Analyzer which controls whether the TokenStreamComponents are reused globally (as they are today) or per-field.

Currently the IW only checks if the infoStream!=null and then passes the message to the method, and that *may* ignore it. For your requirement it is the case that this is enabled or disabled dynamically. Unfortunately if the construction of the message is heavy, then this wastes resources.

I would like to add another method to this class: abstract boolean isEnabled() that can also be implemented. I would then replace all null checks in IW by this method. The default config in IW would be changed to use a NoOutputInfoStream that returns false here and ignores the message.

A simple logger wrapper for e.g. log4j / slf4j then could look like (ignoring component, could be enabled):

{code:java}
Loger log = YourLoggingFramework.getLogger(IndexWriter.class);

public void message(String component, String message) {
  log.debug(component + "": "" + message);
}

public boolean isEnabled(String component) {
  return log.isDebugEnabled();
}
{code}

Using this you could enable/disable logging live by e.g. the log4j management console of your app server by enabling/disabling IndexWriter.class logging.

The changes are really simple:
- PrintStreamInfoStream returns true, always, mabye make it dynamically enable/disable to allow Shai's request
- infoStream.getDefault() is never null and can never be set to null. Instead the default is a singleton NoOutputInfoStream that returns false of isEnabled(component).
- All null checks on infoStream should be replaced by infoStream.isEanbled(component), this is possible as always != null. There are no slowdowns by this - it's like Collections.emptyList() instead stupid null checks."

1,"JNDI Referencable IssuesI'm questioning the use of Referencable in the BindableResource and BindableResourceFactory classes for the JNDI lookup process. Reason for this is because Referencable needs the Addrs to be in the EXACT order in order for it to be considered the same. (see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/naming/Reference.html#equals(java.lang.Object) )

In order for me to get the JNDI reference to be found correctly I had to change the BindableResource.getReference method to swap the order the StringReferences were added to match up what was being passed in by glassfish. This seems EXTREMELY fragile to me as I don't know what order, say JBoss, would pass the StringRefences in in the Reference object for the Factory method.

Also, another problem is that getReference is binding the class name to BindableRepository class implementation and not javax.jcr.Repository. This again causes them not to match if you follow the example on the wiki on setting up the JNDI reference and use javax.jcr.Repository as the type. This can either be fixed by changing the JNDI reference to use the BindableRepository class or the change the BindableRepository class to set that to the Repository interface. Not sure which would be considered 'better'

This completely breaks lucene for these languages, as it treats all queries like 'grep'.

Example: if you query for f:abcd with standardanalyzer, where a,b,c,d are chinese characters, you get a phrasequery of ""a b c d"". if you use cjk analyzer, its no better, its a phrasequery of  ""ab bc cd"", and if you use smartchinese analyzer, you get a phrasequery like ""ab cd"". But the user didn't ask for one, and they cannot turn it off.

The reason is that the code to form phrase queries is not internationally appropriate and assumes whitespace tokenization. If more than one token comes out of whitespace delimited text, its automatically a phrase query no matter what.

The proposed patch fixes the core queryparser (with all backwards compat kept) to only form phrase queries when the double quote operator is used.

1,"SpanRegexQuery and SpanNearQuery is not working with MultiSearcherMultiSearcher is using:
queries[i] = searchables[i].rewrite(original);
to rewrite query and then use combine to combine them.

But SpanRegexQuery's rewrite is different from others.
After you call it on the same query, it always return the same rewritten queries.

As a result, only search on the first IndexSearcher work. All others are using the first IndexSearcher's rewrite queries.
So many terms are missing and return unexpected result.

0,"Pass potent SR to IRWarmer.warm(), and also call warm() for new segmentsCurrently warm() receives a SegmentReader without terms index and docstores.
It would be arguably more useful for the app to receive a fully loaded reader, so it can actually fire up some caches. If the warmer is undefined on IW, we probably leave things as they are.

It is also arguably more concise and clear to call warm() on all newly created segments, so there is a single point of warming readers in NRT context, and every subreader coming from getReader is guaranteed to be warmed up -> you don't have to introduce even more mess in your code by rechecking it.

1,"/contrib/orm-persistence/ OJBPersistenceManagerOJBPersistenceManager seems to have the following problems

1. OJBPersistenceBroker inherites from AbstractPersistenceBroker. There's no 
need of using a non transactional implementation as the feature is available in 
jdbc. 

2. A single broker is used and It's not thread-safe. This is not a problem now 
because it inherits from AbstractPersistenceManager, and the store(ChangeLog ) 
method is synchronized.

3. The broker is never closed so it leaves an open connection.

4. There's no pooling with only one broker.

5 Each write method (e.g. store(NodeState state)) starts its own transaction 
but the transaction should start and end in store(ChangeLog log).

6. It never rollbacks, even when an item in the changelog can't be persisted.

7. The mysql example create MyISAM tables which don't support transactions. 
Innodb tables would be more appropriate.

8. jdbc to java type mapping is wrong for 
class: org.apache.jackrabbit.core.state.orm.ORMBlobValue
field: size
Changed from INTEGER to BIGINT

9. When a Blob value is loaded a ArrayStoreException is thrown because in 
load(PropertyId id) BlobFileValues are added to internalValueList instead of 
InternalValue instances.

10. in store(NodeReferences). When storing a NodeReferences which have some (but not all) the references deleted the OJB persistence Manager doesn't delete any one.

1,"Mixin type lossWhen using a bundle persistence manager, the mixin type information may be corrupted in the lucene index, causing queries like '//element(*, my:mixin)' to fail.



The problem is that the 'jcr:mixinTypes' may be stored in the bundle. Here is how this could happen :


First step: Create a node and add a mixin 'A'.

Everything's fine. The query '//element(*, 'A')' works.


Second step : Select the node and add a second mixin 'B'.

When the second mixin is added, the AbstractBundlePersistenceManager#load(PropertyId) is called to get the current mixins for the node. This method will store the PropertyState for 'jcr:mixinTypes' in the bundle (containing only the mixin 'A'). Then the NodeImpl#setMixinTypesProperty() will set the PropertyState for 'jcr:mixinTypes' in the node state (containing the mixins 'A' and 'B').
When the session is saved, the ChangeLog in AbstractBundlePersistenceManager#store() contains a modification for the 'jcr:mixinTypes' but it's being ignored, leaving the bundle with only mixin 'A'. The NodeIndexer looks into the node state to get the mixin types and indexes the node correctly. The queries '//element(*, 'A')' and '//element(*, 'B')' work.


Thrid step : Select the node and update a property. 

When the session is saved, the NodeIndexer asks again for the 'jcr:mixinTypes' property, by calling the AbstractBundlePersistenceManager#load(PropertyId) to load it. The bundle contains this property and returns only mixin 'A' (as it was stored in the second step), causing the index to use only mixin 'A'. The query '//element(*, 'A')' still works but '//element(*, 'B') doesn't work anymore.



A simple solution to this would be to not store the PropertyState for the 'jcr:mixinTypes' (and 'jcr:uuid' and 'jcr:primaryType', as the class description states) in the bundle when the PropertyState is loaded. It would fix the issue but not the contents on existing repositories. One way to allow the repositories to fix themselves is to not read or write these 3 properties in the BundleBinding#readBundle and BundleBinding#writeBundle methods, but I'm not sure wether or not it would have a performance impact.

0,"Demo HTML parser gives incorrect summaries when title is repeated as a headingIf you have an html document where the title is repeated as a heading at the top of the document, the HTMLParser will return the title as the summary, ignoring everything else that was added to the summary. Instead, it should keep the rest of the summary and chop off the title part at the beginning (essentially the opposite). I don't see any benefit to repeating the title in the summary for any case.

In HTMLParser.jj's getSummary():

    String sum = summary.toString().trim();
    String tit = getTitle();
    if (sum.startsWith(tit) || sum.equals(""""))
      return tit;
    else
      return sum;

change it to: (* denotes a line that has changed)

    String sum = summary.toString().trim();
    String tit = getTitle();
*    if (sum.startsWith(tit))             // don't repeat title in summary

It seems that the copying of the listeners triggered this exception:

    private void notifyRegistered(QName ntName) {
        // copy listeners to array to avoid ConcurrentModificationException
        NodeTypeRegistryListener[] la =
                new NodeTypeRegistryListener[listeners.size()];
        Iterator iter = listeners.values().iterator();
        int cnt = 0;
1750:   while (iter.hasNext()) {

                la[i].nodeTypeRegistered(ntName);
            }
        }
    }

The methods ""notifyReRegistered"" and ""notifyUnregistered"" will probably suffer from the same problem.

Reproduction of this exception may be tricky; it only occurred once in our application. It is probably a race condition: another thread might access the listeners during the copy. It may be helpful to use a debugger and set a breakpoint in the middle of the copy giving other threads the opportunity to access the listeners...

We think that a possible solution is the following:

    /**
     * Notify the listeners that a node type <code>ntName</code> has been registered.
     */
    private void notifyRegistered(QName ntName) {
        // copy listeners to array to avoid ConcurrentModificationException
    	NodeTypeRegistryListener[] la;
    	synchronized (listeners) {
            la = (NodeTypeRegistryListener[]) listeners.values().toArray(new NodeTypeRegistryListener[listeners.size()]);
		}

        for (int i = 0; i < la.length; i++) {
            if (la[i] != null) {
                la[i].nodeTypeRegistered(ntName);
            }
        }

0,"Add unit test showing how to do a ""live backup"" of an indexThe question of how to backup an index comes up every so often on the

admin task that many applications need to do for fault tolerance.

In the past you were forced to stop & block all changes to your index,
perform the backup, and then resume changes.  But many applications
cannot afford a potentially long pause in their indexing.

With the addition of DeletionPolicy (LUCENE-710), it's now possible to
do a ""live backup"", which means backup your index in the background
without pausing ongoing changes to the index.  This
SnapshotDeletionPolicy just has to mark the chosen commit point as not
deletable, until the backup finishes.

0,"Sun hotspot compiler bug in 1.6.0_04/05 affects LuceneThis is not a Lucene bug.  It's an as-yet not fully characterized Sun
JRE bug, as best I can tell.  I'm opening this to gather all things we
know, and to work around it in Lucene if possible, and maybe open an
issue with Sun if we can reduce it to a compact test case.

It's hit at least 3 users:

  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200803.mbox/%3c8c4e68610803180438x39737565q9f97b4802ed774a5@mail.gmail.com%3e

It's specific to at least JRE 1.6.0_04 and 1.6.0_05, that affects
Lucene.  Whereas 1.6.0_03 works OK and it's unknown whether 1.6.0_06
shows it.

The bug affects bulk merging of stored fields.  When it strikes, the
segment produced by a merge is corrupt because its fdx file (stored
fields index file) is missing one document.  After iterating many
times with the first user that hit this, adding diagnostics &
assertions, its seems that a call to fieldsWriter.addDocument some
either fails to run entirely, or, fails to invoke its call to
indexStream.writeLong.  It's as if when hotspot compiles a method,
there's some sort of race condition in cutting over to the compiled
code whereby a single method call fails to be invoked (speculation).

Unfortunately, this corruption is silent when it occurs and only later
detected when a merge tries to merge the bad segment, or an
IndexReader tries to open it.  Here's a typical merge exception:

{code}

I've already added assertions to Lucene to detect when this bug
strikes, but since assertions are not usually enabled, I plan to add a
real check to catch when this bug strikes *before* we commit the merge
to the index.  This way we can detect & quarantine the failure and
prevent corruption from entering the index.

"
1,"Destination URI should be normalizedWebdavRequestImpl.getHrefLocator tests if the URI passed as parameter starts with the context path, and passes the next segments to the locator factory.
 
There is a potential hole if the parameter contains "".."", because ""http://example.com/dav/../foo"" starts with the context path ""http://example.com/dav"" but represents to ""http://example.com/foo"". Currently, it is up to the locator factory to detect this situation, meaning that every locator factory should implement this check. Additionally, DavLocatorFactory.createResourceLocator cannot throw exceptions, hence it would not fail cleanly (RuntimeException causing a 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR response, when a 403 FORBIDDEN status code would have been apropriate)

Note that the Request-URI should have already been normalized by the servlet container, but in COPY/MOVE operations, the Destination-URI is not normalized.

Conformant clients MUST NOT use dot-segments (""."" or "".."")  [RFC 4918, Section 8.3] in Simple-Ref constructions such as the Destination header [RFC 4918, Section 10.3]), but the server should be able to detect this error.

Proposed change in WebdavRequestImpl:193 (in package org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav from webdav/java)
- ref = uri.getRawPath();
+ ref = uri.normalize().getRawPath();

(This causes /dav/../foo to be rejected because it doesn't start with the context path, and accepts dav/foo/../bar because it starts with the context path)"

1,"close() throws incorrect IllegalStateEx after IndexWriter hit an OOME when autoCommit is trueSpinoff from http://www.nabble.com/IllegalStateEx-thrown-when-calling-close-to20201825.html

When IndexWriter hits an OOME, it records this and then if close() is
called it calls rollback() instead.  This is a defensive measure, in
case the OOME corrupted the internal buffered state (added/deleted
docs).

But there's a bug: if you opened IndexWriter with autoCommit true,
close() then incorrectly throws an IllegalStatException.

This fix is simple: allow rollback to be called even if autoCommit is
true, internally during close.  (External calls to rollback with
autoCommmit true is still not allowed).

0,"AttributeSource holds strong reference to class instances and prevents unloading e.g. in Solr if webapplication reload and custom attributes in separate classloaders are used (e.g. in the Solr plugins classloader)When working on the dynmaic proxy classes using cglib/javaassist i recognized a problem in the caching code inside AttributeSource:
- AttributeSource has a static (!) cache map that holds implementation classes for attributes to be faster on creating new attributes (reflection cost)
- AttributeSource has a static (!) cache map that holds a list of all interfaces implemented by a specific AttributeImpl

Also:
- VirtualMethod in 3.1 hold a map of implementation distances keyed by subclasses of the deprecated API

Both have the problem that this strong reference is inside Lucene's classloader and so persists as long as lucene lives. The classes referenced can never be unloaded therefore, which would be fine if all live in the same classloader. As soon as the Attribute or implementation class or the subclass of the deprecated API are loaded by a different classloder (e.g. Lucene lives in bootclasspath of tomcat, but lucene-consumer with custom attributes lives in a webapp), they can never be unloaded, because a reference exists.

Libs like CGLIB or JavaAssist or JDK's reflect.Proxy have a similar cache for generated class files. They also manage this by a WeakHashMap. The cache will always work perfect and no class will be evicted without reason, as classes are only unloaded when the classloader goes and this will only happen on request (e.g. by Tomcat)."

1,".war distribution should be configurable, prompting you to setup JNDI with the Repository Home and Config locations.The Embedded Deployment Model documentation (http://jackrabbit.apache.org/doc/deploy/howto-model1.html) on the jackrabbit page describes how to package up a .war file so that you can use JNDI Resource settings to change the location of the repository home and the repository configuration xml file.

Unfortunately, the .war file that is provided as part of the Jackrabbit distribution doesn't behave like this. Instead, it has an inbuilt repository.xml file and settings in web.xml that act as defaults. These defaults are not useful and force a user to act like a developer and modify the files within the .war file.

The current situation is that we have a .war that's not going to be useful to anyone without modification. The repository.xml file that is contained within the .war makes the repository home to be the Tomcat/bin/repository directory. This is not a useful default. It's better to have no default setup and a clear error message that JNDI needs to be setup. It would be even better if the web application could recognise when the JNDI wasn't configured and could prompt the user with an instructional webpage, describing how to setup the required JNDI settings on Tomcat, JBoss etc.

----

The .war distribution for Jackrabbit ignores the JNDI settings that are described in the documentation. I am using this Tomcat config.xml snippet to configure Tomcat 5.5:

{{{
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<Context displayName=""Ark"" docBase=""c:\dev\ark\jackrabbit-server-1.1.1.war"" path=""/ark"" 
         useNaming=""false"" workDir=""work\Catalina\localhost\ark"" unpackWAR=""false"">

          configFilePath=""c:/dev/ark/src/main/resources/repository.xml""
          repHomeDir=""c:/jackrabbitrepo""/>

</Context>
}}}

Jackrabbit loads fine. However, the logs show:

{{{

}}}






----

My use case is that I want to use Jackrabbit to host a Maven 2 repository within my company. So, ideally I want to:
   * Download the Jackrabbit .war file and mount it on my Tomcat server as context ""/maven2"".
   * Configure Tomcat to use LDAP authentication and point it at my company's LDAP server. This is a standard J2EE feature, of course.
   * Create my own repository.xml file which points to my AccessManager implementation (which goes to my company's SingleSignOn service for authorization). My AccessManager implementation will be placed on the Tomcat shared classpath.
   * Set the repository home directory, where all the working files will be placed and the location of the repository.xml file. Ideally, this would be done in JNDI.

If I have to put together my own Jackrabbit .war file, I consider that I have my ""developer"" hat on when I only really want to have my ""Jackrabbit user"" hat on.

0,"No way to get the requestBody out of a PostMethod or use if extending classAttempting to extend the PostMethod class I discovered that I had no access to 
the requestBody because the member is declared private and there is no get 
method.

I was trying to override the setRequestContentLength() when I discovered the 
problem.

So my enhancement request specifically is:
1. add a get method to be able to get the requestBody (probably a get method to 
the parameters as well)
2. (optionally) make the requestBody and parameters members protected instead 
of private so extending the class is easier.

In case you were wondering, the reason for extending the class was to add the 
ability to set a timeout value on the httpconnection and also the ability to 
set the character encoding of the request body.  I don't know if these are 
worthy of an enhancement request but I require them for what I'm doing.  Nice 
work by the way.

Thank you."

0,"Make lazy loading proxy callback SerializableHello (probably Christophe :) ),

It would be nice to have the CGLib callbacks Serializable, because if they're not, the proxies are not either, even if the target is.

I've seen that you've made BeanLazyLoader Serializable. Wouldn't be better to have AbstractLazyLoader Serializable, so CollectionLazyLoader is too?

What I've done is :
*) declaring AbstractLazyLoader as Serializable
*) declaring non-Serializable resources such as Session as volatile
*) throwing an IllegalStateException in BeanLazyLoader.fetch and CollectionLazyLoader.fetch if the Session is null. This case can only happen if the proxy has been serialized without the volatile Session, and it doesn't make sense to lazy load the target then.

BTW, I realized I didn't clean up the beanClassDescriptor in BeanLazyLoader.cleanUp, so I corrected this.

I'll attach the modified classes.

0,"Setting SSLSocket parametersIn HttpClient 4.0.3, it was easy to subclass SSLSocketFactory, and set SSLSocket options (e.g. setEnabledCipherSuites() or setSSLParameterse()) before the SSL handshake happened. This way it was possible to e.g. restrict cipher suites on per-HttpClient basis (instead of JVM-wide system properties).

In HttpClient 4.1.1, the design has changed quite a lot, and copy-pasting of several long methods is needed. 

Ideally, SSLSocketFactory should support applying SSLParameters to the socket. However, SSLParameters is Java 1.6, so if we want to keep compatibility with 1.5, that's out.

However, it'd be nice to at least have a method (e.g. ""protected SSLSocket prepareSSLSocket(SSLSocket s)"") that would get called immediately after a socket is retrieved from the socket factory. The default implementation could be just ""return s;"", but subclasses could do something like s.setEnabledCipherSuites() s.setSSLParameters()."
0,"RepositoryLock does not work on NFS sometimesThe RepositoryLock mechanism currently used in Jackrabbit uses FileLock. This doesn't work on some NFS file system. It looks like only NFS version 4 and newer supports locking. Older implementations may throw a IOException ""No locks available"", which means the NFS does not support byte-range locking.

I propose to add a second locking mechanism, and add a configuration option to use it. For example: <FileLocking class=""acme"" />. This second locking mechanism is a cooperative locking protocol that uses a background (watchdog) thread and only uses regular file operations.

1,"Merging between workspaces failsI have setup 2 workspaces in Jackrabbit.  I have a preview and a production
workspace.  These workspaces keep a tree of menu nodes that can have content
associated to those menus.  Each node is of type nt:unstructured and has
mixin types of versionable, lockable, and referenceable.

In our system you are only allowed to edit nodes in the preview workspace.
So what I do is when you go to edit a node we check it out, allow for edits,
then check it in.  This creates a new version on the node.  Then we merge
the node up to the production workspace.  All nodes in the production
workspace are always checked in and not locked.

When I go to do a merge I run into problems when I try to merge a node that
has children.  Lets say I have node A with children B and C.  These all have
the same node types as stated above.  I make a change to a property in Node
A in the preview workspace and now want to merge it into the production
workspace (where it exists already).  Here is the code that is run:

Node destNode = destSession.getNodeByUUID(getUUID());
NodeIterator ni = destNode.merge(""preview"", true);

Now this fails in the ItemImpl.internalRemove() method with a
VersionException of cannot remove a child of a checked-in node.  Here is the
trace for the error:
at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.ItemImpl.internalRemove(ItemImpl.java:848)

at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.NodeImpl.merge(NodeImpl.java:3003)

Now if I understand correctly when doing a merge the node that you are
trying to merge to needs to be older then the source node and the
destination node cannot be checked out (NodeImpl.doMergeTest() is where I
figured that out).  But then when I step through further in the merge in
NodeImpl it gets all the nodes of the src node and retrieves the same
children in the destination workspace and then tries to remove those
destination children but it can't remove those children b/c the parent node
(which is node A in the production workspace) is not checked out, but
according to the mergeTest it can't be checked out or the merge won't even
begin."

0,"Making Term Vectors more accessibleOne of the big issues with term vector usage is that the information is loaded into parallel arrays as it is loaded, which are then often times manipulated again to use in the application (for instance, they are sorted by frequency).

Adding a callback mechanism that allows the vector loading to be handled by the application would make this a lot more efficient.

I propose to add to IndexReader:
abstract public void getTermFreqVector(int docNumber, String field, TermVectorMapper mapper) throws IOException;
and a similar one for the all fields version

Where TermVectorMapper is an interface with a single method:
void map(String term, int frequency, int offset, int position);

The TermVectorReader will be modified to just call the TermVectorMapper.  The existing getTermFreqVectors will be reimplemented to use an implementation of TermVectorMapper that creates the parallel arrays.  Additionally, some simple implementations that automatically sort vectors will also be created.

This is my first draft of this API and is subject to change.  I hope to have a patch soon.

1,"Bundle persistence managers node id key store/load is not symertric on MySql causing NoSuchItemState Exceptions It looks like the binary values read back from MySql where the UUID contains 0's is not the same as that generated from the UUID getRawBytes() call. As result, you can store a node with the UUID that has 0's but its never found when read back. This therefore causes corruption in random places when certain UUIDs are generated.

Test Case: 

I've attached 2 files. One causes node corruption when imported, the other does not.
The only difference is that I removed any 0 values from the problem UUID in the file that causes corruption.

As Stefan pointed out, I had manipulated the test case to use standard nt types when in fact I should have provided the following info (sorry Stefan) e.g. the test folder types are referencable hence the jcr:uuid allocation

[acme:Folder] > nt:folder, mix:referenceable

If I import causes_corruption.xml and then attempt to ""ls"" AclObjectIdentities then loadBundle() returns null for the UUID 

a55f3f6b-a909-4e8d-b65a-93002ced0920 which in bytes is [-91, 95, 63, 107, -87, 9, 78, -115, -74, 90, -109, 0, 44, -19, 9, 32]

If I import works.xml then ""ls"" works fine for the same node as I've manually changed the UUID to replace 0s with 1s in the last section.

a55f3f6b-a909-4e8d-b65a-93112ced1921 [-91, 95, 63, 107, -87, 9, 78, -115, -74, 90, -109, 17, 44, -19, 25, 33]


Testing shows this issue highlights a problem with the Bundle persistence manager and MySqls method of handling BINARY columns.
The solution looks to be to replace BINARY(16) with VARBINARY(16). Quoting from http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/binary-varbinary.html...
""If the value retrieved must be the same as the value specified for storage with no padding, it might be preferable to use VARBINARY or one of the BLOB data types instead.""
A review of our logs shows that all of the corruption we've seen has related to nodes with UUIDs including 0's.

* Shall I log a JIRA ticket for this?
* Anyone see any issues with this fix?

0,"Make the Highlighter use SpanScorer by defaultI've always thought this made sense, but frankly, it took me a year to get the SpanScorer included with Lucene at all, so I was pretty much ready to move on after I it got in, rather than push for it as a default.

I think it makes sense as the default in Solr as well, and I mentioned that back when it was put in, but alas, its an option there as well.

The Highlighter package has no back compat req, but custom has been conservative - one reason I havn't pushed for this change before. Might be best to actually make the switch in 3? I could go either way - as is, I know a bunch of people use it, but I'm betting its the large minority. It has never been listed in a changes entry and its not in LIA 1, so you pretty much have to stumble upon it, and figure out what its for.

I'll point out again that its just as fast as the standard scorer for any clause of a query that is not position sensitive. Position sensitive query clauses will obviously be somewhat slower to highlight, but that is because they will be highlighted correctly rather than ignoring position."

Unfortunately the seed doesn't [consistently] repro for me..."
0,"Improve BufferedIndexInput.readBytes() performanceDuring a profiling session, I discovered that BufferedIndexInput.readBytes(),
the function which reads a bunch of bytes from an index, is very inefficient
in many cases. It is efficient for one or two bytes, and also efficient
for a very large number of bytes (e.g., when the norms are read all at once);
But for anything in between (e.g., 100 bytes), it is a performance disaster.
It can easily be improved, though, and below I include a patch to do that.

The basic problem in the existing code was that if you ask it to read 100
bytes, readBytes() simply calls readByte() 100 times in a loop, which means
we check byte after byte if the buffer has another character, instead of just
checking once how many bytes we have left, and copy them all at once.

My version, attached below, copies these 100 bytes if they are available at
bulk (using System.arraycopy), and if less than 100 are available, whatever
is available gets copied, and then the rest. (as before, when a very large
number of bytes is requested, it is read directly into the final buffer).

In my profiling, this fix caused amazing performance
improvement: previously, BufferedIndexInput.readBytes() took as much as 25%
of the run time, and after the fix, this was down to 1% of the run time! However, my scenario is *not* the typical Lucene code, but rather a version of Lucene with added payloads, and these payloads average at 100 bytes, where the original readBytes() did worst. I expect that my fix will have less of an impact on ""vanilla"" Lucene, but it still can have an impact because it is used for things like reading fields. (I am not aware of a standard Lucene benchmark, so I can't provide benchmarks on a more typical case).

In addition to the change to readBytes(), my attached patch also adds a new
unit test to BufferedIndexInput (which previously did not have a unit test).
This test simulates a ""file"" which contains a predictable series of bytes, and
then tries to read from it with readByte() and readButes() with various
sizes (many thousands of combinations are tried) and see that exactly the
expected bytes are read. This test is independent of my new readBytes()
inplementation, and can be used to check the old implementation as well.

By the way, it's interesting that BufferedIndexOutput.writeBytes was already efficient, and wasn't simply a loop of writeByte(). Only the reading code was inefficient. I wonder why this happened."

"
0,"Store all metadata in human-readable segments fileVarious index-reading components in Lucene need metadata in addition to data.
This metadata is presently stored in arbitrary binary headers and spread out
over several files.  We should move to concentrate it in a single file, and 
this file should be encoded using a human-readable, extensible, standardized 
data serialization language -- either XML or YAML.

* Making metadata human-readable makes debugging easier.  Centralizing it
  makes debugging easier still.  Developers benefit from being able to scan
  and locate relevant information quickly and with less debug printing.  Users
  get a new window through which to peer into the index structure.
* Since metadata is written to a separate file, there would no longer be a 
  need to seek back to the beginning of any data file to finish a header, 
  solving issue LUCENE-532.
* Special-case parsing code needed for extracting metadata supplied by 
  different index formats can be pared down.  If a value is no longer 
  necessary, it can just be ignored/discarded.
* Removing headers from the data files simplifies them and makes the file
  format easier to implement. 
* With headers removed, all or nearly all data structures can take the
  form of records stacked end to end, so that once a decoder has been
  selected, an iterator can read the file from top to tail.  To an extent,
  this allows us to separate our data-processing algorithms from our
  serialization algorithms, decoupling Lucene's code base from its file
  format.  For instance, instead of further subclassing TermDocs to deal with
  ""flexible indexing"" formats, we might replace it with a PostingList which
  returns a subclass of Posting.  The deserialization code would be wholly
  contained within the Posting subclass rather than spread out over several
  subclasses of TermDocs.
* YAML and XML are equally well suited for the task of storing metadata, 
  but in either case a complete parser would not be needed -- a small subset 
  of the language will do.  KinoSearch 0.20's custom-coded YAML parser 
  occupies about 600 lines of C -- not too bad, considering how miserable C's 
  string handling capabilities are. "

1,"method.getURI()  returns escaped URIs but it shouldn'tHi guys,

Please, consider the following imaginary and simplified code:


URI u = new URI(""http://some.host.com/%41.html"", true);
HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
GetMethod method = new GetMethod();
method.setURI(u);
URI u2 = method.getURI();

System.out.println(""1. "" + u);
System.out.println(""2. "" + new String(u.getRawURI()));
System.out.println(""3. "" + u.getURI());
System.out.println(""4. "" + u2);
System.out.println(""5. "" + new String(u2.getRawURI()));
System.out.println(""6. "" + u2.getURI());


The result that you'll get is:

1. http://some.host.com/%41.html
2. http://some.host.com/%41.html
3. http://some.host.com/A.html
4. http://some.host.com/%2541.html
5. http://some.host.com/%2541.html
6. http://some.host.com/%41.html


You can see that for lines 4, 5, and 6, the URI suddenly gets escaped (the 
percent sign gets converted to %25).

Why is that? Am I doing something wrong? Is this the desired behaviour? I would 
have expected to get the SAME URI back, without any escaping.

Besides, I have another question:

After executing a method -- httpClient.executeMethod(method) -- what will 
method.getURI() return? The URI *after* all redirections or the original URI? 
It seems I get the URI *after* the redirections, which is fine, but the 
documentation doesn't say that. It only explicitly says that the getPath() 
method has that behaviour.

Best regards and thanks,
Bisser"
1,"RepositoryImpl.acquireRepositoryLock() fails to detect that the file lock is already held by the current processwith java 1.4 and 1.5 on a *nix-based platform it is possible to (concurrently) instantiate 
more than one repository instance in the same jvm based on same/identical configurations.

this is a critical issue since it might lead to data corruption.

the issue only exists with java versions prior to 1.6 and *nix-based platforms (only verified
on mac os-x 10.4).

note that the issue does not exist when the file lock is held by another jvm.

 code snippet to reproduce the issue:

            Repository rep1 = new TransientRepository();
            Session s1 = rep1.login(new SimpleCredentials(""johndoe"", """".toCharArray()));
            Repository rep2 = new TransientRepository();
            Session s2 = rep2.login(new SimpleCredentials(""johndoe"", """".toCharArray()));


the root problem is the incorrect behavior of java.nio.channels.FileChannel#tryLock()
which is demonstrated by the following code snippet:

            try {
                FileLock fl1 = new FileOutputStream(""foo"").getChannel().tryLock();
                System.out.println(""1st lock: "" + fl1);

0,"Observation: avoid running out of memoryJackrabbit uses an unbounded observation queue for event listeners (for asynchronous listeners, which are the default). If an observation listener is very slow, the observation queue gets larger and larger, and the JVM will eventually run out of memory.

I suggest to use a maximum queue size of 100'000 by default. Adding new events to the queue will block until the observation listeners removed an item. I'm not sure if we need a way to configure this option; probably a system property is enough as a start (we can still add a better way to configure this setting if it turns out somebody actually needs a different value).

A special case is observation listeners that themselves write to the repository and therefore cause new events. In this case, it doesn't make sense to block adding an event, because that would block the whole system. However a warning should be written to the log file."

0,"Cleanup MMapDirectory to use only one MMapIndexInput impl with mapping sized of powers of 2Robert and me discussed a little bit after Mike's investigations, that using SingleMMapIndexinput together with MultiMMapIndexInput leads to hotspot slowdowns sometimes.

We had the following ideas:
- MultiMMapIndexInput is almost as fast as SingleMMapIndexInput, as the switching between buffer boundaries is done in exception catch blocks. So normal code path is always the same like for Single*
- Only the seek method uses strange calculations (the modulo is totally bogus, it could be simply: int bufOffset = (int) (pos % maxBufSize); - very strange way of calculating modulo in the original code)
- Because of speed we suggest to no longer use arbitrary buffer sizes. We should pass only the power of 2 to the indexinput as size. All calculations in seek and anywhere else would be simple bit shifts and AND operations (the and masks for the modulo can be calculated in the ctor like NumericUtils does when calculating precisionSteps).
- the maximum buffer size will now be 2^30, not 2^31-1. But thats not an issue at all. In my opinion, a buffer size of 2^31-1 is stupid in all cases, as it will no longer fit page boundaries and mmapping gets harder for the O/S.

We will provide a patch with those cleanups."
1,"RMI published Repository using the jcr-rmi library gets lost over timeThe jcr-server/webapp project contains a servlet - RepositoryStartupServlet - which may be used in a web app to start a repository and optionally register the repository with JNDI and RMI. To register the repository with JNDI, the jcr-rmi library is used to create a Remote repository instance, which is registered with the RMI registry. Inside the RMI implementation mechanisms based on stub classes created by the RMI compiler are created to make the remote repository available remotely. This includes creating a object table to map remote references to local objects. This table stores references to the local object as weak references to support distributed garbage collection.

Over time, it may now be that this remote repository instance is actually collected and the object table cannot access it anymore thus preventing the repository from being accessed remotely. To prevent this from happening, the RepositoryStartupServlet must keep a strong reference to the remote repository and drop this reference when the servlet is destroyed and the repository unregistered.

*NOTE:* This is an issue to all long running applications which publish repository instances over RMI using the jcr-rmi library."

1,"cache does not honor must-revalidate or proxy-revalidate Cache-Control directiveshttp://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.9.4

There are a couple of missed requirements here regarding must-revalidate and proxy-revalidate (which applies only to shared caches).
1. When a cache entry with this directive is revalidated, it must be an end-to-end revalidation (meaning it must include 'max-age=0' on the request).
2. If the revalidation with the origin fails, the cache MUST NOT return a stale entry and MUST return a 504 response.

1,"NPE in RequestProxyAuthentication on AndroidGot a NPE backtrace in RequestProxyAuthentication.process().

        if (route.isTunnelled()) {      <= line 88, NPE here
            return;

There's no null check on the returned route although getRoute() can return null.
I guess it's not supposed to happen.

In the httpclient code, there's a few more calls to getRoute() without a null check on the returned route.

1,"Clustering is broken due to duplicated CachingPersistenceManager interfaceThere are now two interfaces CachingPersistenceManager in the packages org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle and org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.pool. A persistence manager that implements the ..bundle... interface doesn't receive the onExternalUpdate events that are required for clustering to work.

I will move this interface to the package org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence and remove the second implementation.

This change has no affect to backward compatibility, because anyway there were many breaking changes in the past (NodeId / UUID for example).

0,"Fine grained locking in SharedItemStateManagerThe SharedItemStateManager (SISM) currently uses a simple read-write lock to ensure data consistency. Store operations to the PersistenceManager (PM) are effectively serialized.

We should think about more sophisticated locking to allow concurrent writes on the PM.

One possible approach:

If a transaction is currently storing data in a PM a second transaction may check if the set of changes does not intersect with the first transaction. If that is the case it can safely store its data in the PM.

This fine grained locking must also be respected when reading from the SISM. A read request for an item that is currently being stored must be blocked until the store is finished."
1,"SO_TIMEOUT is not set on a request levelThe scenario is as follows: I'm doing two consecutive requests to the same host, using a multi-threaded (or thread safe) connection pool manager. The first invocation has a timeout of 10s and the second has a timeout of 30s. 

In version 3.1 of HttpClient all works well, but in 4.0 I get a timeout exception in the second request, after ~10 seconds, which means the first timeout is used.

Looking at the code, I see that in version 3.1, the HttpMethodDirector.executeWithRetry() method invokes a method named applyConnectionParams() that took care of setting the timeout taken from the request on the socket. 

But in version 4.0, the only place I see the timeout is set on the socket is when DefaultRequestDirector.execute(HttpHost, HttpRequest, HttpContext) opens a connection using the managedConn.open() method. Since the connection is reused between the requests, the second request uses a socket with a timeout of the first request.

1,"StaleItemStateException with distributed transactionsThere seams to be a serious bug in jackrabbit when used in distributed transactions. It does not occur with local transactions! And it seams to be related to JCR-566.

There are 2 scenarios where a StaleItemStateException occurs reproducible that causes transactions to fail. All my operations (implemented in a custom ServiceBean) such as setProperty() or deleteNode() run in separate transactions. The transactions are configured through Spring Annotations (@Transactional).

Scenario A (setProperty):
(1) multiple setProperty() with same property name on the same node (newly created or already existent)
=> With the 3. setProperty() (and sometimes also the 5.), a StaleItemStateException for the property state is raised when the transaction is commited. Following setProperty invocations will not fail!

Scenario B (deleteNode):
(1) iterate 10 times:
(1.1) create new node n and a subnode for n
(1.2) delete node n
=> Deletion of node n raises a StaleItemStateException for node n in iteration 1, 3 and (6 or 7), when the related transaction is commited. Following deletions of node n will also fail with a predictable pattern.

The Exception trace for scenario A (it's the same for scenario B, with one difference: StaleItemStateException is raised for the node and not for the property):

When debugging into jackrabbit you will see, that the cause of the StaleItemStateException is, that the local state und the overlayed state differ in the value of the 'modCount' attribute: modCount of local state is lower than modCount of overlayed state. Perhaps its a state caching problem...
	
I'm attaching a simple java application configured with maven and ready to run standalone. The JCA container of JBoss is therefore replaced with jencks in order to support distributed transactions. The configured repository uses the InMemPersistenceManager. Both scenarios are implemented in a TestNG - test, that catches the occuring TransactionExceptions and prints out the stacktrace. Therefore you will see the exceptions, but the tests will not fail."

1,"DocViewSaxEventGenerator may generate non-NS-wellformed XMLThe XML serialization code relies on the fact that all required prefix-to-uri mappings are known beforehand (actually, when serializing the root node). So there's an assumption that the permanent namespace registry will never change during serialization, which may be incorrect when another client adds namespace registrations while the XML export is in progress.

To fix this, ""addNamespacePrefixes"" should ensure that namespace declarations have been written for all prefixes used on the current node (node name + properties), potentially going back to the namespace resolver when needed.

0,"RepositoryConfig instance can not be reused once it has been passed to RepositoryImpl constructorRepositoryConfig and other *Config classes maintain state apart from parsed configuration information;
specifically they instantiate FileSystem implementations based on their configurations. this makes it
for the config consumers very hard to control the lifecycle of such FileSystem instances as they need
to close the file systems on repository shutdown.

the following code illustrates the issue:

RepositoryConfig repConf = RepositoryConfig.create(configFile, repHomeDir);
RepositoryImpl rep = RepositoryImpl.create(repConf);
// ...
rep.shutdown();

rep = RepositoryImpl.create(repConf);

It seems, that virtual item state providers are asked for whatever property is looked for and this in return calls into the version handler, which loops over some child entries (currently around 1100 entries) to find one single entry with a given UUID.

see attached diff that shows the difference to the most recent repository-1.4.dtd

if nobody objects i would put the proposed repository-1.5.dtd to the site.
once this is done i can properly adjust the repository.xml files (uncommenting the DOCTYPE tag) and start committing the new security functionality.

A simple solution would be to make the Log a static member variable, and do this on all classes for consistency.  However this might not be the best solution for interoperating with some frameworks (see http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-commons/Logging/StaticLog)

Another solution would be to simply remove the Log from the affected classes, although they are presumably there for a reason...

0,"MultiReader.norm() takes up too much memory: norms byte[] should be made into an ObjectMultiReader.norms() is very inefficient: it has to construct a byte array that's as long as all the documents in every segment.  This doubles the memory requirement for scoring MultiReaders vs. Segment Readers.  Although this is cached, it's still a baseline of memory that is unnecessary.

The problem is that the Normalization Factors are passed around as a byte[].  If it were instead replaced with an Object, you could perform a whole host of optimizations
a.  When reading, you wouldn't have to construct a ""fakeNorms"" array of all 1.0fs.  You could instead return a singleton object that would just return 1.0f.
b.  MultiReader could use an object that could delegate to NormFactors of the subreaders
c.  You could write an implementation that could use mmap to access the norm factors.  Or if the index isn't long lived, you could use an implementation that reads directly from the disk.

The patch provided here replaces the use of byte[] with a new abstract class called NormFactors.  
NormFactors has two methods on it
    public abstract byte getByte(int doc) throws IOException;  // Returns the byte[doc]
    public float getFactor(int doc) throws IOException;            // Calls Similarity.decodeNorm(getByte(doc))

There are four implementations of this abstract class
1.  NormFactors.EmptyNormFactors - This replaces the fakeNorms with a singleton that only returns 1.0
2.  NormFactors.ByteNormFactors - Converts a byte[] to a NormFactors for backwards compatibility in constructors.
3.  MultiNormFactors - Multiplexes the NormFactors in MultiReader to prevent the need to construct the gigantic norms array.
4.  SegmentReader.Norm - Same class, but now extends NormFactors to provide the same access.

In addition, Many of the Query and Scorer classes were changes to pass around NormFactors instead of byte[], and to call getFactor() instead of using the byte[].  I have kept around IndexReader.norms(String) for backwards compatibiltiy, but marked it as deprecated.  I believe that the use of ByteNormFactors in IndexReader.getNormFactors() will keep backward compatibility with other IndexReader implementations, but I don't know how to test that.

0,"Flush volatile index when size limit is reachedCurrently the volatile index is committed when minMergeDocs is reached. This is inconvenient because it does not take the size of nodes into account account. When lots of small nodes are added the volatile index should be committed less frequently. Similarly when nodes with lots of properties are indexed the volatile index should be committed more frequently.

Instead the size of the volatile index in bytes should trigger a disk write."
0,"Define clear semantics for Directory.fileLengthOn this thread: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-dev/201003.mbox/%3C126142c1003121525v24499625u1589bbef4c0792e7@mail.gmail.com%3E it was mentioned that Directory's fileLength behavior is not consistent between Directory implementations if the given file name does not exist. FSDirectory returns a 0 length while RAMDirectory throws FNFE.

The problem is that the semantics of fileLength() are not defined. As proposed in the thread, we'll define the following semantics:

* Returns the length of the file denoted by <code>name</code> if the file exists. The return value may be anything between 0 and Long.MAX_VALUE.
* Throws FileNotFoundException if the file does not exist. Note that you can call dir.fileExists(name) if you are not sure whether the file exists or not.

For backwards we'll create a new method w/ clear semantics. Something like:

{code}
/**
 * @deprecated the method will become abstract when #fileLength(name) has been removed.
 */
public long getFileLength(String name) throws IOException {
  long len = fileLength(name);
  if (len == 0 && !fileExists(name)) {
    throw new FileNotFoundException(name);
  }
  return len;
}
{code}

The first line just calls the current impl. If it throws exception for a non-existing file, we're ok. The second line verifies whether a 0 length is for an existing file or not and throws an exception appropriately."

0,"Change all FilteredTermsEnum impls into TermsEnum decoratorsCurrently, FilteredTermsEnum has two ctors:
* FilteredTermsEnum(IndexReader reader, String field)
* FilteredTermsEnum(TermsEnum tenum)

But most of our concrete implementations (e.g. TermsRangeEnum) use the IndexReader+field ctor

In my opinion we should remove this ctor, and switch over all FilteredTermsEnum implementations to just take a TermsEnum.

Advantages:
* This simplifies FilteredTermsEnum and its subclasses, where they are more decorator-like (perhaps in the future we could compose them)
* Removes silly checks such as if (tenum == null) in every next()
* Allows for consumers to pass in enumerators however they want: e.g. its their responsibility if they want to use MultiFields or not, it shouldnt be buried in FilteredTermsEnum.

I created a quick patch (all core+contrib+solr tests pass), but i think this opens up more possibilities for refactoring improvements that haven't yet been done in the patch: we should explore these too.

                + name.replace(':', '-') + "".txt"";
            Reader reader = new InputStreamReader(

The above works when the file being read in has line-separators that match the operating system the test is being run on.  However, if there is a mismatch, the string comparison will fail.

The fix is to replace line-separators in both strings being compared:

Helper method to replace line separators

    /** Standardize line separators around ""\n"". */
    public String replaceLineSeparators(String stringValue) {
        // Replace ""\r\n"" (Windows format) with ""\n"" (Unix format)

0,"Position based TermVectorMapperAs part of the new TermVectorMapper approach to TermVectors, the ensuing patch loads term vectors and stores the term info by position.  This should let people directly index into a term vector given a position.  Actually, it does it through Maps, b/c the array based bookkeeping is a pain given the way positions are stored.  

The map looks like:
Map<String,   Map<Integer, TVPositionInfo>>

where the String is the field name, the integer is the position, and TVPositionInfo is a storage mechanism for the terms and offsets that occur at a position.  It _should_ handle multiple terms per position (which is always my downfall! )

I have not tested performance of this approach.

1,"jcr2spi: Item.isSame may return wrong result if any ancestor is invalidatedjulian detected an issue with jcr2spi that was previously shadowed due to heavy reloading of items upon save.
with the most recent changes however reloading of items is postponed until the next access. this will cause the following test to fail:

        Node n = testRootNode.addNode(""aFile"", ""nt:file"");
        n = n.addNode(""jcr:content"", ""nt:resource"");
        n.setProperty(""jcr:lastModified"", Calendar.getInstance());
        n.setProperty(""jcr:mimeType"", ""text/plain"");
        Property jcrData = n.setProperty(""jcr:data"", ""abc"", PropertyType.BINARY);
        testRootNode.save();

        // access same property through different session
        Session otherSession = helper.getReadOnlySession();
        try {
            Property otherProperty = (Property) otherSession.getItem(jcrData.getPath());
            assertTrue(jcrData.isSame(otherProperty));
        } finally {
            otherSession.logout();
        }

while 
     
       assertTrue(n.isSame(otherSession.getItem(n.getPath()));

would be successful.

the reason: the jcrData property is not reloaded and it's parent is still _invalidated_. consequently the property isn't aware of it's id having changed due to the fact that nt:resource is a node type extending from mix:referenceable.

possible fixes:

1) mark all items _invalid_ after save 
    instead of setting status non-protected/autocreated properties to EXISTING.
    -> forcing jcrData to be reloaded before isSame can be called.
    -> drawback: much more round trip(s) to the server just to make sure the id is up to date.

2) change Item#isSame to make sure the workspaceId is up to date (walking up the
     hierarchy and force reloading of the first invalidated ancestor).
     -> drawback: if referenceable nodes are rare or missing at all, this causes some
          extra round trips.
 
3) change Item.isSame to compare the 'workspacePath' instead of the 'workspaceId'.
     -> drawback: upon persisted move of a referenceable node Item#isSame will return false


after taking a closer look at the code and at some additional tests i would opt for 2).

0,"Hardening of NativeFSLockNativeFSLock create a test lock file which its name might collide w/ another JVM that is running. Very unlikely, but still it happened a couple of times already, since the tests were parallelized. This may result in a false exception thrown from release(), when the lock file's delete() is called and returns false, because the file does not exist (deleted by another JVM already). In addition, release() should give a second attempt to delete() if it fails, since the file may be held temporarily by another process (like AntiVirus) before it fails. The proposed changes are:

1) Use ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName() as part of the test lock name (should include the process Id)
2) In release(), if delete() fails, check if the file indeed exists. If it is, let's attempt a re-delete() few ms later.
3) If (3) still fails, throw an exception. Alternatively, we can attempt a deleteOnExit.

I'll post a patch later today."
0,"CompoundFileReader's openInput produces streams that may do an extra buffer copySpinoff of LUCENE-888.

The class for reading from a compound file (CompoundFileReader) has a
primary stream which is a BufferedIndexInput when that stream is from
an FSDirectory (which is the norm).  That is one layer of buffering.

Then, when its openInput is called, a CSIndexInput is created which
also subclasses from BufferedIndexInput.  That's a second layer of
buffering.

When a consumer actually uses that CSIndexInput to read, and a call to
readByte or readBytes runs out of what's in the first buffer, it will
go to refill its buffer.  But that refill calls the first
BufferedIndexInput which in turn may refill its buffer (a double
copy) by reading the underlying stream.

Not sure how to fix it yet but we should change things to not do the
extra buffer copy.

The TestConcurrentMergeScheduler throws intermittant exceptions that

The exception happens in the ""testNoWaitClose()"" test, which repeated

still-running merges.  When a merge is aborted it can hit various
exceptions because the files it is reading and/or writing have been
deleted, so we ignore these exceptions.

The bug was just that we were failing to properly check whether the
running merge was actually aborted because of a scoping issue of the
""merge"" variable in ConcurrentMergeScheduler.  So the exceptions are
actually ""harmless"".  Thanks to Ning for spotting it!

The culprit is that the java.io.tmpdir property was incorrectly specified on the user's system.  Lucene could easily handle this issue by modifying the FSDirectory.init() method.  Currently the code uses the index directory if java.io.tmpdir and org.apache.lucene.lockDir are unspecified, but it could use that directory if those values are unspecified OR if they are invalid.  Doing so would make Lucene a bit more robust without breaking any existing installations.

1,"Problem with redirect on HEAD when (bad, naughty) server returns body contentI've been testing/using HttpClient 2.0a3 with Resin 2.1.9. I've found that when
using a HEAD request on a JSP, Resin returns the body content along with the
headers.

In this case, something in the HttpClient breaks. Looking at the httpclient
logs, it looks like:

1) HttpClient does a HEAD against the original URL
2) Resin returns valid status line and headers
3) HttpClient parses the headers and recognizes the redirect header
4) HttpClient does a HEAD against the new URL (from the Location header)
5) HttpMethodBase calls readStatusLine, which (eventually) calles readRawLine in
HttpConnection (which reads from the internal inputStream)
6) readRawLine returns the first line in the body from the original HEAD request
in (1).

It looks like the original body content (in response to the first HEAD) is being
buffered somewhere, but I can't figure out where.

I know that this is invalid behavior on the server's part, but I would like to
be able to recover from it.

1,"TokenSources.getTokenStream() does not assign positionIncrementTokenSources.StoredTokenStream does not assign positionIncrement information. This means that all tokens in the stream are considered adjacent. This has implications for the phrase highlighting in QueryScorer when using non-contiguous tokens.

For example:
Consider  a token stream that creates tokens for both the stemmed and unstemmed version of each word - the fox (jump|jumped)
When retrieved from the index using TokenSources.getTokenStream(tpv,false), the token stream will be - the fox jump jumped

Now try a search and highlight for the phrase query ""fox jumped"". The search will correctly find the document; the highlighter will fail to highlight the phrase because it thinks that there is an additional word between ""fox"" and ""jumped"". If we use the original (from the analyzer) token stream then the highlighter works.

Also, consider the converse - the fox did not jump
""not"" is a stop word and there is an option to increment the position to account for stop words - (the,0) (fox,1) (did,2) (jump,4)
When retrieved from the index using TokenSources.getTokenStream(tpv,false), the token stream will be - (the,0) (fox,1) (did,2) (jump,3).

So the phrase query ""did jump"" will cause the ""did"" and ""jump"" terms in the text ""did not jump"" to be highlighted. If we use the original (from the analyzer) token stream then the highlighter works correctly."

0,"UUIDDocId cache does not work properly because of weakReferences in combination with new instance for combined indexreader Queries that use ChildAxisQuery or DescendantSelfAxisQuery make use of getParent() functions to know wether the parents are correct and if the result is allowed. The getParent() is called recursively for every hit, and can become very expensive. Hence, in DocId.UUIDDocId, the parents are cached. 

Currently,  docId.UUIDDocId's are cached by having a WeakRefence to the CombinedIndexReader, but, this CombinedIndexReader is recreated all the time, implying that a gc() is allowed to remove the 'expensive' cache.

A much better solution is to not have a weakReference to the CombinedIndexReader, but to a reference of each indexreader segment. This means, that in getParent(int n) in SearchIndex the return 

return id.getDocumentNumber(this) needs to be replaced by return id.getDocumentNumber(subReaders[i]); and something similar in CachingMultiReader. 

That is all. Obviously, when a node/property is added/removed/changed, some parts of the cached DocId.UUIDDocId will be invalid, but mainly small indexes are updated frequently, which obviously are less expensive to recompute."

0,"Unit tests TestBackwardsCompatibility and TestIndexFileDeleter might fail depending on JVMIn the two units tests TestBackwardsCompatibility and TestIndexFileDeleter several index file names are hardcoded. For example, in TestBackwardsCompatibility.testExactFileNames() it is tested if the index directory contains exactly the expected files after several operations like addDocument(), deleteDocument() and setNorm() have been performed. Apparently the unit tests pass on the nightly build machine, but in my environment (Windows XP, IBM JVM 1.5) they fail for the following reason:

When IndexReader.setNorm() is called a new norm file for the specified field is created with the file  ending .sx, where x is the number of the field. The problem is that the SegmentMerger can not guarantee to keep the order of the fields, in other words after a merge took place a field can have a different field number. This specific testcase fails, because it expects the file ending .s0, but the file has the ending .s1.

The reason why the field numbers can be different on different JVMs is the use of HashSet in SegmentReader.getFieldNames(). Depending on the HashSet implementation an iterator might not iterate over the entries in insertion order. When I change HashSet to LinkedHashSet, the two testcases pass.

However, even with a LinkedHashSet the order of the field numbers might change during a merge, because the order in which the SegmentMerger merges the FieldInfos depends on the field options like TERMVECTOR, INDEXED... (see SegmentMerger.mergeFields() for details). 

So I think we should not use LinkedHashSet but rather change the problematic testcases. Furthermore I'm not sure if we should have hardcoded filenames in the tests anyway, because if we change the index format or file names in the future these test cases would fail without modification."

0,"lucenetestcase ease of use improvementsI started working on this in LUCENE-2658, here is the finished patch.

There are some problems with LuceneTestCase:
* a tests beforeClass, or the test itself (its @befores and its method), might have some
  random behavior, but only the latter can be reproduced with -Dtests.seed
* if you want to do things in beforeClass, you have to use a different API: newDirectory(random)
  instead of newDirectory, etc.
* for a new user, the current output can be verbose, confusing and overwhelming.

So, I refactored this class to address these problems. 
A class still needs 2 seeds internally, as the beforeClass will only run once, 
but the methods or setUp() might run many times, especially when increasing iterations.

but lucenetestcase deals with this, and the ""seed"" is 128-bit (UUID): 
the MSB is initialized in beforeClass, the LSB varied for each method run.
if you provide a seed with a -D, they are both fixed to the UUID you provided.

I fixed the API to be consistent, so you should be able to migrate a test from 
setUp() to beforeClass() [junit3 to junit4] without changing parameters.

The codec, locale, timezone is only printed once at the end if any tests fail, 
as its per-class anyway (setup in beforeClass)

finally, when a test fails, you get a single ""reproduce with"" command line you can copy and paste to reproduce.
this way you dont have to spend time trying to figure out what the command line should be.

Basically, there are situations where it would be useful to sort by freq first, instead of the current ""sort by edit distance, and then subsort by freq if edit distance is equal""

The author of the thread suggested ""What I think would work even better than allowing a custom compareTo function would be to incorporate the frequency directly into the distance function.  This would allow for greater control over the trade-off between frequency and edit distance""

However, custom compareTo functions are not always be possible (ie if a certain version of Lucene must be used, because it was release with Solr) and incorporating freq directly into the distance function may be overkill (ie depending on the implementation)

it is suggested that we have a simple modification of the existing compareTo function in Lucene to allow users to specify if they want the existing sort method or if they want to sort by freq.

I'm one of these beginners trying to make their way in Jackrabbit and content repositories universe.

Besides the fact that there exist but very few examples on Jackrabbit use, all of them, including the official web site of Jackrabbit miss few details, simple though essential, for beginners.

My first point is the following: once Jackrabbit source is checked out and built, time to test it using simple examples. But, where to put the example directory from the beginning. How to run it (maven java:compile....) ?

A second point is the fact that there is no help forum on the Jackrabbit web site.

 A third point, taking my case as an example, the example would just not create a new workspace configuration.
And many other troubleshoots - I repeat - basic but essential, that could avoid dozens of wasted hours and discouragment, if just mentioned on the website.

There are two ways this could be implemented:
- as a single Similarity.Stats class, reused by all ranking algorithms. In this case, this class would have a member field for all statistics;
- as a hierarchy of Stats classes, one for each ranking algorithm. Each subclass would define only the statistics needed for the ranking algorithm.

In the second case, the Stats class in DefaultSimilarity would have a single field, idf, while the one in e.g. BM25Similarity would have idf and average field/document length."

1,"JackrabbitIndexReader prevents use of DocNumberCacheThe JackrabbitIndexReader was introduced in 1.5 by JCR-1363. Unfortunately it does not overwrite the method termDocs(Term), which means the default implementation in IndexReader is used. This bypasses the DocNumberCache built into CachingIndexReader, which is used for UUID terms that look up individual documents."

0,"Wrong schemaObjectPrefix parameter in default repository.xmlThe object schema prefix is hard-coded in the default configuration file (I think this taken from the jackrabbit-core.jar):

        <PersistenceManager class=""org.apache.jackrabbit.core.persistence.bundle.DerbyPersistenceManager"">
          <param name=""url"" value=""jdbc:derby:${wsp.home}/db;create=true""/>
          <param name=""schemaObjectPrefix"" value=""Jackrabbit Core_""/>
        </PersistenceManager>

This is probably caused by JCR-945, though I've no idea why ${wsp.name} is replaced with the name of the module...

I have marked this issue as minor because it still works with the DerbyPersistenceManager. There are separate database instances for each workspace, but it will become a problem if a data base persistence manager on a dedicated server is used."
1,"SloppyPhraseScorer returns non-deterministic results for queries with many repeatsProximity queries with many repeats (four or more, based on my testing) return non-deterministic results. I run the same query multiple times with the same data set and get different results.

So far I've reproduced this with Solr 1.4.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and latest 4.0 trunk.

Steps to reproduce (using the Solr example):
1) In solrconfig.xml, set queryResultCache size to 0.
2) Add some documents with text ""dog dog dog"" and ""dog dog dog dog"". http://localhost:8983/solr/update?stream.body=%3Cadd%3E%3Cdoc%3E%3Cfield%20name=%22id%22%3E1%3C/field%3E%3Cfield%20name=%22text%22%3Edog%20dog%20dog%3C/field%3E%3C/doc%3E%3Cdoc%3E%3Cfield%20name=%22id%22%3E2%3C/field%3E%3Cfield%20name=%22text%22%3Edog%20dog%20dog%20dog%3C/field%3E%3C/doc%3E%3C/add%3E&commit=true
3) Do a ""dog dog dog dog""~1 query. http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=%22dog%20dog%20dog%20dog%22~1
4) Repeat step 3 many times.

Expected results: The document with id 2 should be returned.

Actual results: The document with id 2 is always returned. The document with id 1 is sometimes returned.

Different proximity values show the same bug - ""dog dog dog dog""~5, ""dog dog dog dog""~100, etc show the same behavior.

So far I've traced it down to the ""repeats"" array in SloppyPhraseScorer.initPhrasePositions() - depending on the order of the elements in this array, the document may or may not match. I think the HashSet may be to blame, but I'm not sure - that at least seems to be where the non-determinism is coming from."

0,"Add AttributeSource.copyTo(AttributeSource)One problem with AttributeSource at the moment is the missing ""insight"" into AttributeSource.State. If you want to create TokenStreams that inspect cpatured states, you have no chance. Making the contents of State public is a bad idea, as it does not help for inspecting (its a linked list, so you have to iterate).

AttributeSource currently contains a cloneAttributes() call, which returns a new AttrubuteSource with all current attributes cloned. This is the (more expensive) captureState. The problem is that you cannot copy back the cloned AS (which is the restoreState). To use this behaviour (by the way, ShingleMatrix can use it), one can alternatively use cloneAttributes and copyTo. You can easily change the cloned attributes and store them in lists and copy them back. The only problem is lower performance of these calls (as State is a very optimized class).

One use case could be:
{code}
AttributeSource state = cloneAttributes();
// .... do something ...
state.getAttribute(TermAttribute.class).setTermBuffer(foobar);
// ... more work
state.copyTo(this);
{code}"
1,"ObjectIterator may return null, which is not readily expected from an IteratorThe ObjectIterator class implements an Iterator of objects mapped from an underlying NodeIterator. This ObjectIterator may return null from next() if no mapping for a node in the iterator exists. Rather than returning null, the iterator should probably just ignore the unmappable node and return an object from the next node in the underlying iterator which is mappable."

Currently all child items that are not part of the effective node type of the new primary type get their definition reset or are removed in case not matching definition is found.

0,"Always use bulk-copy when merging stored fields and term vectorsLucene has nice optimizations in place during merging of stored fields
(LUCENE-1043) and term vectors (LUCENE-1120) whereby the bytes are
bulk copied to the new segmetn.  This is much faster than decoding &
rewriting one document at a time.

However the optimization is rather brittle: it relies on the mapping
of field name to number to be the same (""congruent"") for the segment
being merged.

Unfortunately, the field mapping will be congruent only if the app
adds the same fields in precisely the same order to each document.

I think we should fix IndexWriter to assign the same field number for
a given field that has been assigned in the past.  Ie, when writing a
new segment, we pre-seed the field numbers based on past segments.
All other aspects of FieldInfo would remain fully dynamic."
1,"DataStore: garbage collection can fail when using workspace maxIdleTimeThe GarbageCollectorTest fails because some workspaces have an idle timeout. The data store garbage collector should prevent workspace close-on-idle.

Proposed solution: instead of using the 'regular' system sessions in the garbage collector, use special 'registered system sessions'. The sessions get garbage collected when no longer used, that means this patch requires that JCR-1216 ""Unreferenced sessions should get garbage collected"" is applied. So for each workspace, the code is:

// this will initialize the workspace if required
wspInfo.getSystemSession();

SessionImpl session = SystemSession.create(rep, wspInfo.getConfig());
// mark this session as 'active' for so the workspace does
// not get disposed by workspace-janitor until the garbage collector is done
rep.onSessionCreated(session);

1,"SSL connections cannot be established using resolvable IP addressHttpClient 4.1 introduced a regression in establishing SSL connections to remote peers (it seems this is a common regression for major httpclient updates, see HTTPCLIENT-803).
The new SSLSocketFactory.connectSocket method calls the X509HostnameVerifier with InetSocketAddress.getHostName() parameter. When the selected IP address has a reverse lookup name, the verifier is called with the resolved name, and so the IP check fails.
4.0 release checked for original ip/hostname, but this cannot be done with the new connectSocket() method. 
The TestHostnameVerifier.java only checks 127.0.0.1/.2 and so masked the issue, because the matching certificate has both ""localhost"" and ""127.0.0.1"", but actually only ""localhost"" is matched. A test case with 8.8.8.8 would be better."

0,"Lucene Search not scallingI've noticed that when doing thousands of searches in a single thread the average time is quite low i.e. a few milliseconds. When adding more concurrent searches doing exactly the same search the average time increases drastically. 
I've profiled the search classes and found that the whole of lucene blocks on 

org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentCoreReaders.getTermsReader
org.apache.lucene.util.VirtualMethod
  public synchronized int getImplementationDistance 
org.apache.lucene.util.AttributeSourcew.getAttributeInterfaces

These cause search times to increase from a few milliseconds to up to 2 seconds when doing 500 concurrent searches on the same in memory index. Note: That the index is not being updates at all, so not refresh methods are called at any stage.


Some questions:
  Why do we need synchronization here?
  There must be a non-lockable solution for these, they basically cause lucene to be ok for single thread applications but disastrous for any concurrent implementation.

I'll do some experiments by removing the synchronization from the methods of these classes."

0,"allow different strategies when checking CN of x509 certWe're now doing a decent job for checking the CN of the x509 cert with https:

http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-613

I think the patch for HTTPCLIENT-613 should cover 99.9% of the users out there.  But there are some more esoteric possibilities, so I think Oleg is right.  We need to let the user change the strategy, or provide their own strategy if they want to. 

Some additional things to think about:

- http://wiki.cacert.org/wiki/VhostTaskForce !!!   CN is depreciated?!?!   (I am not able to find a popular website on HTTPS that isn't using CN!)

- [*.example.com] matches subdomains [a.b.example.com] on Firefox, but not IE6.  The patch for HTTPCLIENT-613 allows subdomains.

- Should we support multiple CN's in the subject?

- Should we support ""subjectAltName=DNS:www.example.com"" ?  Should we support lots of them in a single cert?

- Should we support a mix of CN and subjectAltName?


If we do create some alternate strategies for people to try, I'd probably lean towards something like this:

X509NameCheckingStrategy.SUN_JAVA_6  (default)
X509NameCheckingStrategy.FIREFOX2
X509NameCheckingStrategy.IE7

1,"MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager does not properly respond to thread interruptsMultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager uses interrupts to notify waiting threads when a connection is ready for them. Issues arise if the threads are interrupted by someone else while they are still waiting on a thread, because doGetConnection does not remove the threads from the queue of waiting threads when they are interrupted:

                        connectionPool.wait(timeToWait);

                        // we have not been interrupted so we need to remove ourselves from the 
                        // wait queue
                        hostPool.waitingThreads.remove(waitingThread);                        connectionPool.waitingThreads.remove(waitingThread);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        // do nothing                    } finally {
                        if (useTimeout) {
                            endWait = System.currentTimeMillis();
                            timeToWait -= (endWait - startWait);                        }                    }

Under ordinary circumstances, the queue maintenance is done by the notifyWaitingThread method. However, if the thread is interrupted by any other part of the system, it will (1) not actually be released, since the loop in doGetConnection will force it back to the wait, and (2) will be added the waiting thread to the queue repeatedly, which basically means that the thread will eventually receive the interrupt from notifyWaitingThread at some later point, when it is no longer actually waiting for a connection.

This code could probably be re-architected to make it less error-prone, but the fundamental issue seems to be the use of interrupts to signal waiting threads, as opposed to something like a notify. "

from my understanding of the specification these methods should always return the standard JCR path (or name) representation as it

We also use the mask for required clauses, but this code is now

if we re-enable this code (and I think we should, at least in certain
cases: I suspect it'd be faster than BS2 in many cases), I think we
can cutover to an int count instead of bit masks, and then have no
limit on the required clauses sent to BooleanScorer also.

an editing session that is only allowed to write in a subtree but isn't allowed to access the root node will not be

the reason for this is, that both SessionImpl.save() and SessionImpl.refresh(boolean) access the root node
in order to execute the call. since it's the regular call READ permissions are checked, although the user
made no attempt to *look* at the root.

A workaround would be to call Item.save() on the modified tree itself that obviously was visible for the 
user... unfortunately that method is deprecated as of JCR 2.0. Therefore, I have the impression that we
should fix the methods mentioned above.

1,"(Parallel-)MultiSearcher: using Sort object changes the scoresExample: 
Hits hits=multiSearcher.search(query);
returns different scores for some documents than
Hits hits=multiSearcher.search(query, Sort.RELEVANCE);
(both for MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher)

The documents returned will be the same and in the same order, but the scores in the second case will seem out of order.

Inspecting the Explanation objects shows that the scores themselves are ok, but there's a bug in the normalization of the scores.

The document with the highest score should have score 1.0, so all document scores are divided by the highest score.  (Assuming the highest score was>1.0)

However, for MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher, this normalization factor is applied *per index*, before merging the results together (the merge itself is ok though).

An example: if you use
Hits hits=multiSearcher.search(query, Sort.RELEVANCE);
for a MultiSearcher with two subsearchers, the first document will have score 1.0.
The next documents from the same subsearcher will have decreasing scores.
The first document from the other subsearcher will however have score 1.0 again !

The same applies for other Sort objects, but it is less visible.

I will post a TestCase demonstrating the problem and suggested patches to solve it in a moment..."

There is another area where there is an attempt to upgrade a read lock to write lock, RepositoryImpl.WorkspaceInfo.disposeIfIdle() acquires a read lock and calls dispose() which then acquires a write lock, this maybe ok, as I assume there is only 1 thread that will attempt to dispose of idle workspaces.

1,"When BG merge hits an exception, optimize sometimes throws an IOException missing the root cause
When IndexWriter.optimize() is called, ConcurrentMergeScheduler will
run the requested merges with background threads and optimize() will
wait for these merges to complete.

If a merge hits an exception, it records the root cause exception such
that optimize can then retrieve this root cause and throw its own
exception, with the root cause.

But there is a bug: sometimes, the fact that an exception occurred on
a merge is recorded, but the root cause is missing.  In this cause,
optimize() still throws an exception (correctly indicating that the
optimize() has not finished successfully), but it's not helpful
because it's missing the root cause.  You must then go find the root
cause in the JRE's stderr logs.

This has hit a few users on this lists, most recently:

  http://www.nabble.com/Background-merge-hit-exception-td19540409.html#a19540409

I found the isssue, and finally got a unit test to intermittently show
it.  It's a simple thread safety issue: in a finally clause in
IndexWriter.merge we record the fact that the merge hit an exception
before actually setting the root cause, and then only in
ConcurrentMergeScheduler's exception handler do we set the root
cause.  If the optimize thread is scheduled in between these two, it
can throw an exception missing its root cause.

The fix is straightforward.  I plan to commit to 2.4 & 2.9.

0,"Expose explicit 2-phase commit in IndexWriterCurrently when IndexWriter commits, it does so with a two-phase
commit, internally: first it prepares all the new index files, syncs

that is successful does it remove any now un-referenced index files.

However, these two phases are done privately, internal to the commit()

But when Lucene is involved in a transaction with external resources
(eg a database), it's very useful to explicitly break out the prepare

1,"Lucene is not fsync'ing files on commitThanks to hurricane Irene, when Mark's electricity became unreliable, he discovered that on power loss Lucene could easily corrumpt the index, which of course should never happen...

I was able to easily repro, by pulling the plug on an Ubuntu box during indexing.  On digging, I discovered, to my horror, that Lucene is failing to fsync any files, ever!

This bug was unfortunately created when we committed LUCENE-2328... that issue added tracking, in FSDir, of which files have been closed but not sync'd, so that when sync is called during IW.commit we only sync those files that haven't already been sync'd.

That tracking is done via the FSDir.onIndexOutputClosed callback, called when an FSIndexOutput is closed.  The bug is that we only call it on exception during close:

{noformat}

    @Override
    public void close() throws IOException {
      // only close the file if it has not been closed yet
      if (isOpen) {
        boolean success = false;
        try {
          super.close();
          success = true;
        } finally {
          isOpen = false;
          if (!success) {
            try {
              file.close();
              parent.onIndexOutputClosed(this);
            } catch (Throwable t) {
              // Suppress so we don't mask original exception
            }
          } else
            file.close();
        }
      }
    }
{noformat}

And so FSDir thinks no files need syncing when its sync method is called....

I think instead we should call it up-front; better to over-sync than under-sync.

The fix is trivial (move the callback up-front), but I'd love to somehow have a test that can catch such a bad regression in the future.... still I think we can do that test separately and commit this fix first.

Note that even though LUCENE-2328 was backported to 2.9.x and 3.0.x, this bug wasn't, ie the backport was a much simpler fix (to just address the original memory leak); it's 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and trunk when this bug is present."

1,"FSDirectory.getDirectory always creates index pathThis was reported to me as a Luke bug, but going deeper it proved to be a non-intuitive (broken?) behavior of FSDirectory.

If you use FSDirectory.getDirectory(File nonexistent) on a nonexistent path, but one that is located under some existing parent path, then FSDirectory:174 uses file.mkdirs() to create this directory. One would expect a variant of the method with a boolean flag to decide whether or not to create the output path. However, the API with ""create"" flag is now deprecated, with a comment that points to IndexWriter's ""create"" flag. This comment is misleading, because the indicated path is created anyway in the file system just by calling FSDirectory.getDirectory().

I propose to do one of the following:

* reinstate the variant of the method with ""create"" flag. In case if this flag is false, and the index directory is missing, either return null or throw an IOException,

* keep the API as it is now, but either return null or throw IOException if the index dir is missing. This breaks the backwards compatibility, because now users are required to do file.mkdirs() themselves prior to calling FSDirectory.getDirectory()."

0,"httpclient doesn't read and parse response from certain types of proxy servers when POST method is usedIt was determined that when sending post data to server via Squid proxy server
of version 2.4.STABLE2 and Squid responds 
with ""407 proxy authentication required"" response, httpclient doesn't read this
response in order to parse, but rather
fails with soket exception ""java.net.SocketException: Software caused connection
abort: recv failed"".

This behaviour is reproduced with the latest nigtly build of httpclient version
3.0. (from 9 of February 2005) as
well as 3.0. RC1, 2.0.2 and 2.0.

This is the piece of code that sends post data using httpclient:

try
{
	HttpClientParams httpClientParams = new HttpClientParams();
	HttpClient client = new HttpClient(httpClientParams);

	HostConfiguration hostconfig = new HostConfiguration();
	hostconfig.setProxy(""db00-devl.eps.agfa.be"", 3128); // SQUID proxy server
version 2.4.STABLE2
	client.setHostConfiguration(hostconfig);
	PostMethod postMethod = new
PostMethod(""http://brugge.eps.agfa.be/portal03/servlet/selectFiles"");

	postMethod.addParameter(""data"", ""some data"");
	int status = client.executeMethod(postMethod);
	System.out.println(""status = "" + status);
	if (status == HttpStatus.SC_OK)
		System.out.println(""Ok"");
	else if (status == HttpStatus.SC_PROXY_AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED)
		System.out.println(""Proxy authentication required."");
}
catch (Exception e)
{
	System.out.println(""Socket exception."");
	e.printStackTrace();
}

Look at ""debug log of the problem"" attachment to see all output from httpclient
and mentioned piece of code.
In ""problem_request_response_interaction"" attacment it is possible to see
interaction beetween httpclient and Squid proxy server: httpclient sends initial
request and headers, then squid responds with ""proxy authentication required""
response and afterwards httpclient tries to send post data(without reading the
response) but fails because connection is already closed.

For more details look at ""ethereal_problem"" attachment for all network traffic
during running of mentioned piece of code:
Ethereal protocol analyzer can be used to open this file(http://www.ethereal.com/).

Most likely this particular version of Squid closes connection after it sends
proxy athentication response back,
which causes httpclient to fail while sending post data.

Let's have a look at what writeRequest(...) method of HttpMethodBase class does:

1) sends request line and headers to server,
2) handles 'Expect: 100-continue' handshake if needed,
3) sends post data to server.

My question is should HTTPClient send initial request and headers before data
even if it is not going to read 
a response from the server(proxy server), or this should be done only in case of
'Expect: 100-continue' handshake 
(this seems the only case when HTTPClient is going to listen to server
in-between of steps 1 and 3)?

My understanding is that the command

        // make sure the status line and headers have been sent
        conn.flushRequestOutputStream();
        
which actually splits sending of data in two parts are needed only for 'Expect:
100-continue' handshake case.
Just by moving ""flush"" command to appropriate place inside 'Expect:
100-continue' handshake case:
		.....
                try {
	            conn.flushRequestOutputStream(); // moved
                    conn.setSocketTimeout(RESPONSE_WAIT_TIME_MS);
		.....
it is posible to solve described problem.

I created PostMethodEx that overrides writeRequest(...) method of
HttpMethodBase(look at ""PostMethodEx"" attachment) 
and for all cases but the 'Expect: 100-continue' handshake it sends request
line, headers and post data to server 
at once.

When mentioned piece of code(with PostMethod changed to PostMethodEx) is
executed everyting works fine:
look at ""debug log of the fix"", ""fix_request_response_interaction"" and
""ethereal_fix""(all network trafic) 
attachments.

According to mentioned logs httpclient sends all post data at once and then
reads and parses ""proxy authentication required"" 
response from squid and sets status code to 407. Correct."

- FieldCacheRewriteMethod -> This doesn't belong in this contrib or the queries module.  I think we should push it to contrib/misc for the time being.  It seems to have quite a few constraints on when its useful.  If indeed CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO rewrite is better, then I dont see a purpose for it.
- FilterClause -> class inside BooleanFilter
- FuzzyLikeThisQuery -> suggest module. This class seems a mess with its Similarity hardcoded.  With all that said, it does seem to do what it claims and with some cleanup, it could be good.
- TermsFilter -> queries module under .filters package
- SlowCollated* -> They can stay in the module till we have a better place to nuke them.

One of the implications of the above moves, is that the xml-query-parser, which supports many of the queries, will need to have a dependency on the queries module.  But that seems unavoidable at this stage.

1,"Incorrect node position after importI have found a behavior that does not seem to be consistent with the
spec:

After replacing a node with importXML using IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING the new node is not at the position of the replaced node (talking about the position among the siblings).

The origininal node is removed, but the new node is created as the last child of the parent node, and not spec-compliant at the position of the replaced node.

Here how I use it:

// assume Session s, Node n, String text (holding XML data)

s.importXML(
	n.getPath(), 
	new ByteArrayInputStream (text.getBytes(""UTF-8"")),
	ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING
);
s.save();
 

And here a quote from the spec section 7.3.6

ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING: 
If an incoming referenceable node has the same UUID as a node already existing in the workspace then the already existing node is replaced by the incoming node in the same position as the existing node.

0,"JSR 283: JCR Pathwith jsr 283 the jcr path is defined to consist of a combination of the following segments

•	a name segment, (J, I), where J is a JCR name and I is an integer index (I ≥ 1).
•	an identifier segment, U, where U is a JCR identifier.
•	the root segment.
•	the self segment.
•	the parent segment.

-> the name segment can be in extended or qualified form -> see issue JCR-1712
-> the identifier segment is new for jsr283 and always identifies a node (-> see new method Node.getIdentifier())

Non-standard parts always need to be standardized. Any of the following makes a path non-standard:
- expanded name segments
- trailing /
- index [1]

Identifier-segments
- get resolved upon being passed to any API calls that take path to an existing Node
- don't get resolved when being used to create a PATH value object.

Except for PATH values, all jcr paths returned by the API are normalized and standard, thus never identifier-based.

PATH values in contrast:
- must be converted to standard form
- must NOT be normalized. i.e. redundant segments and identifiers must be preserved.

0,"Missing possibility to supply custom FieldParser when sorting search resultsWhen implementing the new TrieRangeQuery for contrib (LUCENE-1470), I was confronted by the problem that the special trie-encoded values (which are longs in a special encoding) cannot be sorted by Searcher.search() and SortField. The problem is: If you use SortField.LONG, you get NumberFormatExceptions. The trie encoded values may be sorted using SortField.String (as the encoding is in such a way, that they are sortable as Strings), but this is very memory ineffective.

ExtendedFieldCache gives the possibility to specify a custom LongParser when retrieving the cached values. But you cannot use this during searching, because there is no possibility to supply this custom LongParser to the SortField.

I propose a change in the sort classes:
Include a pointer to the parser instance to be used in SortField (if not given use the default). My idea is to create a SortField using a new constructor
{code}SortField(String field, int type, Object parser, boolean reverse){code}

The parser is ""object"" because all current parsers have no super-interface. The ideal solution would be to have:

{code}SortField(String field, int type, FieldCache.Parser parser, boolean reverse){code}

and FieldCache.Parser is a super-interface (just empty, more like a marker-interface) of all other parsers (like LongParser...). The sort implementation then must be changed to respect the given parser (if not NULL), else use the default FieldCache.getXXXX without parser."
1,"DateTools needs to use UTC for correct collation,If your local timezone is Europe/London then the times Sun, 30 Oct 2005 00:00:00 +0000 and exactly one hour later are both converted to 200530010000 by DateTools.dateToString() with minute resolution.   The Linux date command is useful in seeing why:

    $ date --date ""Sun, 30 Oct 2005 00:00:00 +0000""
    Sun Oct 30 01:00:00 BST 2005

    $ date --date ""Sun, 30 Oct 2005 01:00:00 +0000""

Both times are 1am in the morning, but one is when DST is in force, the other isn't.   Of course, these are actually different times!

Of course, if dates are stored in the index with implicit timezone information then not only do we get problems when the clocks go back at the end of summer, but we also have problems crossing timezones.   If a database is created in California and used in Paris then the times are going to be badly skewed (there's a nine hour time difference most of the year).

The problem is similar to a database query planner, where sometimes simply doing a full table scan is faster than using an index.

We can optimize automatonquery a little bit, and get better performance for fuzzy,wildcard,regex queries.

Here is a list of ideas:
* create commonSuffixRef for infinite automata, not just really-bad linear scan cases
* do a null check rather than populating an empty commonSuffixRef
* localize the 'linear' case to not seek, but instead scan, when ping-ponging against loops in the state machine
* add a mechanism to enable/disable the terms dict cache, e.g. we can disable it for infinite cases, and maybe fuzzy N>1 also.
* change the use of BitSet to OpenBitSet or long[] gen for path-tracking
* optimize the backtracking code where it says /* String is good to go as-is */, this need not be a full run(), I think...

0,"Cloned SegmentReaders fail to share FieldCache entriesI just hit this on LUCENE-1516, which returns a cloned readOnly
readers from IndexWriter.

The problem is, when cloning, we create a new [thin] cloned
SegmentReader for each segment.  FieldCache keys directly off this
object, so if you clone the reader and do a search that requires the
FieldCache (eg, sorting) then that first search is always very slow
because every single segment is reloading the FieldCache.

This is of course a complete showstopper for LUCENE-1516.

With LUCENE-831 we'll switch to a new FieldCache API; we should ensure
this bug is not present there.  We should also fix the bug in the
current FieldCache API since for 2.9, users may hit this.

0,"Similarity.java javadocs and simplifications for 4.0As part of adding additional scoring systems to lucene, we made a lower-level Similarity

However, I always feel bad about the complexity introduced here (though I do feel there
are some ""excuses"", that its a difficult challenge).

In order to try to mitigate this, we also exposed an easier API (SimilarityBase) on top of

consumable for e.g. experiments.

Still, we can cleanup a few things with the low-level api: fix outdated documentation and

0,"Factor out ByteSliceWriter from DocumentsWriterFieldDataDocumentsWriter uses byte slices into shared byte[]'s to hold the
growing postings data for many different terms in memory.  This is
probably the trickiest (most confusing) part of DocumentsWriter.

Right now it's not cleanly factored out and not easy to separately
test.  In working on this issue:

  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200805.mbox/%3c126142c0805061426n1168421ya5594ef854fae5e4@mail.gmail.com%3e

which eventually turned out to be a bug in Oracle JRE's JIT compiler,
I factored out ByteSliceWriter and created a unit test to stress test
the writing & reading of byte slices.  The test just randomly writes N
streams interleaved into shared byte[]'s, then reads them back
verifying the results are correct.

I created the stress test to try to find any bugs in that code.  The
test ran fine (no bugs were found) but I think the refactoring is
still very much worthwhile.

1,"Revision 949509 (LUCENE-2480) causes IOE ""read past EOF"" when processing older format SegmentInfo data when JVM assertion processing is disabled.At revision 949509 in org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfo at line 155, there is the following code:
{noformat} 
    if (format > SegmentInfos.FORMAT_4_0) {
      // pre-4.0 indexes write a byte if there is a single norms file
      assert 1 == input.readByte();
    }
{noformat} 
Note that the assert statement invokes input.readByte().
If asserts are disabled for the JVM, input.readByte() will not be invoked, causing the following readInt() to return a bogus value, and then causing an IOE during the (mistakenly entered) loop at line 165.
This can occur when processing old format (format ""-9"") index data under Tomcat (whose startup scripts by default do not turn on asserts).

0,"Optimize TermInfosWriter.addI found one more optimization, in how terms are written in
TermInfosWriter.  Previously, each term required a new Term() and a
new String().  Looking at the cpu time (using YourKit), I could see
this was adding a non-trivial cost to flush() when indexing Wikipedia.

I changed TermInfosWriter.add to accept char[] directly, instead.

I ran a quick test building first 200K docs of Wikipedia.  With this
fix it took 231.31 sec (best of 3) and without the fix it took 236.05

The log seem to indicate that the proxy server is returning 200 for ""CONNECT"",

1,"fix analyzer bugs found by MockTokenizerIn LUCENE-3064, we beefed up MockTokenizer with assertions, and I've switched over the analysis tests to use MockTokenizer for better coverage.

However, this found a few bugs (one of which is LUCENE-3106):
* incrementToken() after it returns false in CommonGramsQueryFilter, HyphenatedWordsFilter, ShingleFilter, SynonymFilter
* missing end() implementation for PrefixAwareTokenFilter
* double reset() in QueryAutoStopWordAnalyzer and ReusableAnalyzerBase
* missing correctOffset()s in MockTokenizer itself.

0,"Precompile JavaCC parsers in jackrabbit-spi-commonsThe JavaCC-generated Java source files in jackrabbit-spi-commons require special configuration when importing Jackrabbit sources to an IDE like Eclipse. To make IDE integration smoother it would be nice if precompiled copies of the Java files existed the src/main/java folder.

Precompiling the sources would also allow us to avoid the JavaCC processing step during each Jackrabbit build. Instead we could have a separate profile for explicitly recompiling the JavaCC sources when they have been modified. In the past three years that has happened only once (JCR-952), so I think a bit of extra complexity there is justified by the simplification we can achieve in normal builds and IDE integration."
0,"Adding Event interface and isLocal()when a repository cluster is used, it seems that a common problem many people have is to detect if an observation event is send because of changes on the local instance or a remote instance of the cluster.

This is especially important if you want to do post processing of data
based on observation (the post processing should only be done by one instance in the cluster).

A current solution is to cast the jcr event object to the EventImpl of jackrabbit core which is obviously not a nice solution :)

So what about adding an event interface to jackrabbit api which extends the jcr event interface and adds the isLocal() method? "

in the sort field, the entire call throws an [uncaught] exception during the 
sorting process with no results returned. 

This is an undesireable result, and the prospects for patching this problem 
outside the search classes are ugly, e.g. trying to patch the index itself.

This is actually a critical function in my application. Thank you for 
addressing it.

1,"PostingsConsumer#merge does not call finishDocWe discovered that the current merge function in PostingsConsumer is not calling the #finishDoc method. This does not have consequences for the standard codec (since the lastPosition is set to 0 in #startDoc, and its #finishDoc method is empty), but for the SepCodec, this results in position file corruption (the lastPosition is set to 0 in #finishDoc for the SepCodec)."

0,"Added New Token API impl for ASCIIFoldingFilterI added an implementation of incrementToken to ASCIIFoldingFilter.java and extended the existing  testcase for it.
I will attach the patch shortly.
Beside this improvement I would like to start up a small discussion about this filter. ASCIIFoldingFitler is meant to be a replacement for ISOLatin1AccentFilter which is quite nice as it covers a superset of the latter. I have used this filter quite often but never on a as it is basis. In the most cases this filter does the correct thing (replace a special char with its ascii correspondent) but in some cases like for German umlaut it does not return the expected result. A german umlaut  like 'ä' does not translate to a but rather to 'ae'. I would like to change this but I'n not 100% sure if that is expected by all users of that filter. Another way of doing it would be to make it configurable with a flag. This would not affect performance as we only check if such a umlaut char is found. 
Further it would be really helpful if that filter could ""inject"" the original/unmodified token with the same position increment into the token stream on demand. I think its a valid use-case to index the modified and unmodified token. For instance, the german word ""süd"" would be folded to ""sud"". In a query q:(süd) the filter would also fold to sud and therefore find sud which has a totally different meaning. Folding works quite well but for special cases would could add those options to make users life easier. The latter could be done in a subclass while the umlaut problem should be fixed in the base class.

0,"client cache does not respect 'Cache-Control: no-store' on requests""The purpose of the no-store directive is to prevent the inadvertent release or retention of sensitive information (for example, on backup tapes). The no-store directive applies to the entire message, and MAY be sent either in a response or in a request. If sent in a request, a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this request or any response to it.""

The current implementation will incorrectly cache responses to requests containing 'Cache-Control: no-store'."
0,"Skip sync delay when changes are foundThe cluster synchronization on a slave does always wait for some time (as specified in the sync delay) before fetching changes. If a lot of changes are being written to the master, a slave will considerably fall behind the master in term of revisions, which may endanger the integrity of the cluster if the master will crash. I therefore suggest that a slave should rather immediately contact the master again after some changes have been found, until it sees no more changes."
0,"Replacement for TermAttribute+Impl with extended capabilities (byte[] support, CharSequence, Appendable)For flexible indexing terms can be simple byte[] arrays, while the current TermAttribute only supports char[]. This is fine for plain text, but e.g NumericTokenStream should directly work on the byte[] array.
Also TermAttribute lacks of some interfaces that would make it simplier for users to work with them: Appendable and CharSequence

I propose to create a new interface ""CharTermAttribute"" with a clean new API that concentrates on CharSequence and Appendable.
The implementation class will simply support the old and new interface working on the same term buffer. DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTE_FACTORY will take care of this. So if somebody adds a TermAttribute, he will get an implementation class that can be also used as CharTermAttribute. As both attributes create the same impl instance both calls to addAttribute are equal. So a TokenFilter that adds CharTermAttribute to the source will work with the same instance as the Tokenizer that requested the (deprecated) TermAttribute.

To also support byte[] only terms like Collation or NumericField needs, a separate getter-only interface will be added, that returns a reusable BytesRef, e.g. BytesRefGetterAttribute. The default implementation class will also support this interface. For backwards compatibility with old self-made-TermAttribute implementations, the indexer will check with hasAttribute(), if the BytesRef getter interface is there and if not will wrap a old-style TermAttribute (a deprecated wrapper class will be provided): new BytesRefGetterAttributeWrapper(TermAttribute), that is used by the indexer then."

0,"Expert API to specify indexing chainIt would be nice to add an expert API to specify an indexing chain, so that
we can make use of Mike's nice LUCENE-1301 feature.

This patch simply adds a package-protected expert API to IndexWriter and 
DocumentsWriter. It adds a inner, abstract class to DocumentsWriter called 
IndexingChain, and a default implementation that is the currently used one.

This might not be the final solution, but a nice way to play with different
modules in the indexing chain.

Could you take a look at the patch, Mike? "

1,"FieldSortedHitQueue - subsequent String sorts with different locales sort identicallyFrom my own post to the java-user list. I have looked into this further and am sure it's a bug.

---

It seems to me that there's a possible bug in FieldSortedHitQueue, specifically in getCachedComparator(). This is showing up on our 1.4.3 install, but it seems from source code inspection that if it's a bug, it's in 1.9.1 also.

The issue shows up when you need to sort results from a given IndexReader multiple times, using different locales. On line 180 (all line numbers from the 1.9.1 code), we have this:

ScoreDocComparator comparator = lookup (reader, fieldname, type, factory);

Then, if no comparator is found in the cache, a new one is created (line 193) and then stored in the cache (line 202). HOWEVER, both the cache lookup() and store() do NOT take into account locale; if we, on the same index reader, try to do one search sorted by Locale.FRENCH and one by Locale.ITALIAN, the first one will result in a cache miss, a new French comparator will be created, and stored in the cache. Second time through, lookup() finds the cached French comparator -- even though this time, the locale parameter to getCachedComparator() is an Italian locale. Therefore, we don't create a new comparator and we use the wrong one to sort the results.

It looks to me (unless I'm mistaken) that the FieldCacheImpl.Entry class should have an additional property, .locale, to ensure that different locales get different comparators.

Patch (well, most of one) to follow immediately."
1,"304 response status handlingI have an IBM WebSphere server that returns 304 responses with a Content-
Length header set to something other than 0 and the server is not closing the 
connection.  According to the HTTP RFC 
(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.5):

""The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always 
terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.""

Obviously, the web server is returning a bad response but the HTTPClient 
blocks waiting on data in the response even though there shouldn't be any.  
Other HTTP clients (browsers) do not have this issue and seem to ignore the 
fact that the server set an invalid Content-Length in the response."

1,"Readers wrapping other readers don't prevent usage if any of their subreaders was closedOn recent trunk test we got this problem:
org.apache.lucene.index.TestReaderClosed.test
fails because the inner reader is closed but the wrapped outer ones are still open.

I fixed the issue partially for SlowCompositeReaderWrapper and ParallelAtomicReader but it failed again. The cool thing with this test is the following:

The test opens an DirectoryReader and then creates a searcher, closes the reader and executes a search. This is not an issue, if the reader is closed that the search is running on. This test uses LTC.newSearcher(wrap=true), which randomly wraps the passed Reader with SlowComposite or ParallelReader - or with both!!! If you then close the original inner reader, the close is not detected when excuting search. This can cause SIGSEGV when MMAP is used.

The problem in (in Slow* and Parallel*) is, that both have their own Fields instances thats are kept alive until the reader itsself is closed. If the child reader is closed, the wrapping reader does not know and still uses its own Fields instance that delegates to the inner readers. On this step no more ensureOpen checks are done, causing the failures.

The first fix done in Slow and Parallel was to call ensureOpen() on the subReader, too when requesting fields(). This works fine until you wrap two times: ParallelAtomicReader(SlowCompositeReaderWrapper(StandardDirectoryReader(segments_1:3:nrt _0(4.0):C42)))

One solution would be to make ensureOpen also check all subreaders, but that would do the volatile checks way too often (with n is the total number of subreaders and m is the number of hierarchical levels this is n^m) - we cannot do this. Currently we only have n*m which is fine.

The proposal how to solve this (closing subreaders under the hood of parent readers is to use the readerClosedListeners. Whenever a composite or slow reader wraps another readers, it registers itself as interested in readerClosed events. When a subreader is then forcefully closed (e.g by a programming error or this crazy test), we automatically close the parents, too.

We should also fix this in 3.x, if we have similar problems there (needs investigation)."

1,"2.4.x index cannot be opened with 2.9-devSorry for the lack of proper testcase.

In 2.4.1, if you created an index with the (stupid) options below, then it will not create a .prx file. 2.9 expects this file and will not open the index.
The reason i used these stupid options is because i changed the field from indexed=yes to indexed=no, but forgot to remove the .setOmitTf()

However, I had no idea which test caused that (i.e. opened the temp directory and did not release resources).

I think we should do the following:
* Track in LTC a map from dirName -> StackTraceElement
* In afterClass if _TestUtil.rmDir fails, print the STE of that particular dir, so we know where was this directory created from
* Make tempDirs private and create accessor method, so that we control the inserts to this map (today the Set is updated by LTC, _TestUtils and TestBackwards !)"

0,Caching client has a class for common headers that was not being used consistently in the codeThe HttpCachingClient has a class called HeaderConstants that contains all the cache interesting headers that are used in the code base.  This class of string constants was not being used consistently in the code base.  The attached patch cleans this up.
0,"Hostname verification:  turn off wildcards when CN is an IP addressHostname verification:   turn off wildcards when CN is an IP address.  This is a further improvement on HTTPCLIENT-613 and HTTPCLIENT-614.

Example - don't allow:
CN=*.114.102.2

I'm thinking of grabbing the substring following the final dot, and running it through ""Integer.parseInt()"".  If the NumberFormatException isn't thrown (so Integer.parseInt() actually worked!), then I'll turn off wildcard matching.  Notice that this won't be a problem with IP6 addresses, since they don't use dots.  It's only a problem with IP4, where the meaning of the dots clashes with dots in domain names.

Note:  when I turn off wildcard matching, I still attempt an exact match with the hostname.  If through some weird mechanism the client is actually able to use a hostname such as ""https://*.114.102.2/"", then they will be okay if that's what the certificate on the server contains."

1,Several DocsEnum / DocsAndPositionsEnum return wrong docID when next() / advance(int) return NO_MORE_DOCSDuring work on LUCENE-2878 I found some minor problems in PreFlex and Pulsing Codec - they are not returning NO_MORE_DOCS but the last docID instead from DocsEnum#docID() when next() or advance(int) returned NO_MORE_DOCS. The JavaDoc clearly says that it should return NO_MORE_DOCS.
0,"HttpURLConnection wrapperInitial comments from Vincent Massol for this feature:

I am moving Jakarta Cactus from using the JDK HttpURLConnection to
Commons HttpClient. However, I have some public interface that return
HttpURLConnection and I cannot break that contract with Cactus users.

I propose to write a HttpURLConnection wrapper for HttpMethod (I have
actually already written it but I am currently testing it on Cactus and
will make a proper donation once I am sure it works - i.e all the Cactus
tests pass as before ... ).

I attach a preview of it for those interested.

What do you think of including it in HttpClient distribution ?

Thanks

0,"Clone supportIt would be nice to have a clone method for some of the classes that don't have getters & setters exposed for all of their fields. Where relevant, the clone method could be in the interface, so that it doesn't matter which implementing class is being used. The main interfaces that I would like to clone are HttpRequest and Cookie. I know that HttpRequest is technically part of HttpCore, but the primary implementations of it are in HttpClient, so I thought I would post it here.

0,"Optimize the core tokenizers/analyzers & deprecate Token.termTextThere is some ""low hanging fruit"" for optimizing the core tokenizers
and analyzers:

  - Re-use a single Token instance during indexing instead of creating
    a new one for every term.  To do this, I added a new method ""Token
    next(Token result)"" (Doron's suggestion) which means TokenStream
    may use the ""Token result"" as the returned Token, but is not
    required to (ie, can still return an entirely different Token if
    that is more convenient).  I added default implementations for
    both next() methods in TokenStream.java so that a TokenStream can
    choose to implement only one of the next() methods.

  - Use ""char[] termBuffer"" in Token instead of the ""String
    termText"".

    Token now maintains a char[] termBuffer for holding the term's
    text.  Tokenizers & filters should retrieve this buffer and
    directly alter it to put the term text in or change the term
    text.

    I only deprecated the termText() method.  I still allow the ctors
    that pass in String termText, as well as setTermText(String), but
    added a NOTE about performance cost of using these methods.  I
    think it's OK to keep these as convenience methods?

    After the next release, when we can remove the deprecated API, we
    should clean up Token.java to no longer maintain ""either String or
    char[]"" (and the initTermBuffer() private method) and always use
    the char[] termBuffer instead.

  - Re-use TokenStream instances across Fields & Documents instead of
    creating a new one for each doc.  To do this I added an optional
    ""reusableTokenStream(...)"" to Analyzer which just defaults to
    calling tokenStream(...), and then I implemented this for the core
    analyzers.

I'm using the patch from LUCENE-967 for benchmarking just
tokenization.

The changes above give 21% speedup (742 seconds -> 585 seconds) for
LowerCaseTokenizer -> StopFilter -> PorterStemFilter chain, tokenizing
all of Wikipedia, on JDK 1.6 -server -Xmx1024M, Debian Linux, RAID 5
IO system (best of 2 runs).

If I pre-break Wikipedia docs into 100 token docs then it's 37% faster
(1236 sec -> 774 sec), I think because of re-using TokenStreams across
docs.

I'm just running with this alg and recording the elapsed time:

  analyzer=org.apache.lucene.analysis.LowercaseStopPorterAnalyzer
  doc.tokenize.log.step=50000
  docs.file=/lucene/wikifull.txt
  doc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.LineDocMaker
  doc.tokenized=true
  doc.maker.forever=false

  {ReadTokens > : *

See this thread for discussion leading up to this:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/51283

I also fixed Token.toString() to work correctly when termBuffer is
used (and added unit test).

1,"Bug with textfilters and classloadersI'm having problems with text filter service. I built the contrib/textfilters package and I included the resulting jackrabbit-textfilters-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in my application classpath.

I think that this must to be with Eclipse RCP classloader mechanism, but the fact is that it does not work. I find a little bit strange this way to load services, and as you can see, it seems problematic in some scenarios.

Hi Martin,

we had a similar problem with the query languages, but I solved that one
by telling the registry to use a specific classloader. this seemed to work.
I'm not sure this will also work for the text filters, because the jar
file might be in another classloader.

could you please post a jira bug? I'll then change the discovery
mechanism to use good old xml config ;)

1,"Possible hidden exception on SegmentInfos commitI am not sure if this is that big of a deal, but I just ran into it and thought I might mention it.

SegmentInfos.commit removes the Segments File if it hits an exception. If it cannot remove the Segments file (because its not there or on Windows something has a hold of it), another Exception is thrown about not being able to delete the Segments file. Because of this, you lose the first exception, which might have useful info, including why the segments file might not be there to delete.

0,"replacing an extended mixin with it's supertype is problematicnode.addMixin() / node.removeMixin() have some checks to avoid redundant mixin settings on a node and not only when the node is saved.

eg: have 2 mixins: mix:A and mix:AA where mix:AA > mix:A and a node (N with mix:AA) on it.

then, N.addMixin(mix:A)  has no effect, since it's regarded as redundant.  so you have to remove mix:AA first and then add mix:A.
there is the first problem when applying mixin types programmatically, just be sure to remove them first before adding new ones.

the 2nd problem occurs when mix:A has a mandatory property. then somehow when downgrading from mix:AA to mix:A, some information is lost, and a save call results in

Unable to save node 'N': javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: /test/A: mandatory property {}prop does not exist.
you need to ""touch"" the property, otherwise it will not work.

0,"Make the extraction of Session UserIDs from Subjects configurableThe SessionImpl class must extract a string name from the Prinicpals in a Subject to use as the Session userID.  In 1.4 the SessionImpl class directly selects the first available Principal.  In 1.5, this is delegated to the SecurityManager, which chooses the first  non-group principal.

It would be useful to be able to configure specific selection criteria for the Principal used for the Session userID.  A simple mechanism would involve specifying a Principal implementation classname in the configuration, and the first instance of that class found in the Subject would be used for the userID.  One way to implement this in 1.4 would be to extend AuthContext to include a method getSessionPrincipal() which encapsulates the selection logic, and adding an option the LoginModuleConfig to specify the class name of the Principal to select.

A particular use case is using the LDAP LoginModule from Sun JDK 6 with the repository.  The first Principal LdapLoginModule populates into the Subject is an instance of LdapPrincipal, which renders the userID as the full DN of the user.  The LoginModule also adds an instance of UserPrincipal, whose name is the simple username/uid attribute, which would be more appropriate as the Session userId since it corresponds to the username provided by the user to application authentication mechanisms (the provided username is expanded into the full DN prior to authentication by the login module).  If the above configuration mechanism were available, one could configure the LdapLoginModule, and specify that the userID be extracted from the first instance of com.sun.security.auth.UserPrincipal.  Since rewriting LoginModules is not always possible or desirable, this change would enable the stable integration of 3rd-party login modules that may populate the Subject with several principals."
0,"Performance improvement for merging stored, compressed fieldsHello everyone,

currently the merging of stored, compressed fields is not optimal for the following reason: every time a stored, compressed field is being merged, the FieldsReader uncompresses the data, hence the FieldsWriter has to compress it again when it writes the merged fields data (.fdt) file. The uncompress/compress step is unneccessary and slows down the merge performance significantly.

This patch improves the merge performance by avoiding the uncompress/compress step. In the following I give an overview of the changes I made:
   * Added a new FieldSelectorResult constant named ""LOAD_FOR_MERGE"" to org.apache.lucene.document.FieldSelectorResult
   * SegmentMerger now uses an FieldSelector to get stored fields from the FieldsReader. This FieldSelector's accept() method returns the FieldSelectorResult ""LOAD_FOR_MERGE"" for every field.
   * Added a new inner class to FieldsReader named ""FieldForMerge"", which extends  org.apache.lucene.document.AbstractField. This class holds the field properties and its data. If a field has the FieldSelectorResult ""LOAD_FOR_MERGE"", then the FieldsReader creates an instance of ""FieldForMerge"" and does not uncompress the field's data.
   * FieldsWriter checks if the field it is about to write is an instanceof FieldsReader.FieldForMerge. If true, then it does not compress the field data.


To test the performance I index about 350,000 text files and store the raw text in a stored, compressed field in the lucene index. I use a merge factor of 10. The final index has a size of 366MB. After building the index, I optimize it to measure the pure merge performance.

Here are the performance results:

old version:
   * Time for Indexing:  36.7 minutes
   * Time for Optimizing: 4.6 minutes

patched version:
   * Time for Indexing:  20.8 minutes
   * Time for Optimizing: 0.5 minutes

The results show that the index build time improved by about 43%, and the optimizing step is more than 8x faster. 

A diff of the final indexes (old and patched version) shows, that they are identical. Furthermore, all junit testcases succeeded with the patched version.

  Michael Busch"

1,"disk full can cause index corruption in certain casesRobert uncovered this nasty bug, in adding more randomness to
oal.index tests...

I got a standalone test to show the issue; the corruption path is
as follows:

  * The merge hits an initial exception (eg disk full when merging the
    postings).

  * In handling this exception, IW closes all the sub-readers,
    suppressing any further exceptions.

  * If one of these sub-readers has pending deletions, which happens
    if readers are pooled in IW, it will flush them.  If that flush
    hits a 2nd exception (eg disk full), then SegmentReader
    [incorrectly] leaves the SegmentInfo's delGen advanced by 1,
    referencing a corrupt file, yet the SegmentReader is still
    forcefully closed.

  * If enough disk frees up such that a later IW.commit/close
    succeeds, the resulting segments file will reference an invalid
    deletions file.

Hi Martin,

this is unfortunate and should be improved. the reason why this happens
is the following:
the search index implementation always indexes a node as a whole to
improve query performance. that means even if a single property changes
the parent node with all its properties is re-indexed.

unfortunately the checkin method sets properties in three separate
'transactions', causing the search to re-index the according node three
times.

usually this is not an issue, because the index implementation keeps a
buffer for pending index work. that is, if you change the same property
several times and save after each setProperty() call, it won't actually
get re-indexed several times. but text filters behave differently here,
because they extract the text even though the text will never be used.

eventually this will improve without any change to the search index
implementation, because as soon as versioning participates properly in
transactions there will only be one call to index a node on checkin().

as a quick fix we could improve the text filter classes to only parse
the binary when the returned reader is acutally used."

0,"Improve indexing performance by increasing internal buffer sizesIn working on LUCENE-843, I noticed that two buffer sizes have a
substantial impact on overall indexing performance.

First is BufferedIndexOutput.BUFFER_SIZE (also used by
BufferedIndexInput).  Second is CompoundFileWriter's buffer used to
actually build the compound file.  Both are now 1 KB (1024 bytes).

I ran the same indexing test I'm using for LUCENE-843.  I'm indexing
~5,500 byte plain text docs derived from the Europarl corpus
(English).  I index 200,000 docs with compound file enabled and term
vector positions & offsets stored plus stored fields.  I flush
documents at 16 MB RAM usage, and I set maxBufferedDocs carefully to
not hit LUCENE-845.  The resulting index is 1.7 GB.  The index is not
optimized in the end and I left mergeFactor @ 10.

I ran the tests on a quad-core OS X 10 machine with 4-drive RAID 0 IO
system.

At 1 KB (current Lucene trunk) it takes 622 sec to build the index; if
I increase both buffers to 8 KB it takes 554 sec to build the index,
which is an 11% overall gain!

I will run more tests to see if there is a natural knee in the curve
(buffer size above which we don't really gain much more performance).

I'm guessing we should leave BufferedIndexInput's default BUFFER_SIZE
at 1024, at least for now.  During searching there can be quite a few
of this class instantiated, and likely a larger buffer size for the
freq/prox streams could actually hurt search performance for those
searches that use skipping.

The CompoundFileWriter buffer is created only briefly, so I think we
can use a fairly large (32 KB?) buffer there.  And there should not be
too many BufferedIndexOutputs alive at once so I think a large-ish
buffer (16 KB?) should be OK.

0,"apply delete-by-Term and docID immediately to newly flushed segmentsSpinoff from LUCENE-2324.

When we flush deletes today, we keep them as buffered Term/Query/docIDs that need to be deleted.  But, for a newly flushed segment (ie fresh out of the DWPT), this is silly, because during flush we visit all terms and we know their docIDs.  So it's more efficient to apply the deletes (for this one segment) at that time.

We still must buffer deletes for all prior segments, but these deletes don't need to map to a docIDUpto anymore; ie we just need a Set.

0,"Add a simple FST impl to Lucene
I implemented the algo described at
http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.24.3698 for
incrementally building a finite state transducer (FST) from sorted
inputs.

This is not a fully general FST impl -- it's only able to build up an
FST incrementally from input/output pairs that are pre-sorted.

Currently the inputs are BytesRefs, and the outputs are pluggable --
NoOutputs gets you a simple FSA, PositiveIntOutputs maps to a long,
ByteSequenceOutput maps to a BytesRef.

The implementation has a low memory overhead, so that it can handle a
fairly large set of terms.  For example, it can build the FSA for the
9.8M terms from a 10M document wikipedia index in ~8 seconds (on
beast), using ~256 MB peak RAM, resulting in an FSA that's ~60 MB.

It packs the FST as-it-builds into a compact byte[], and then exposes
the API to read nodes/arcs directly from the byte[].  The FST can be
quickly saved/loaded to/from a Directory since it's just a big byte[].

The format is similar to what Morfologik uses
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/morfologik/).

I think there are a number of possible places we can use this in
Lucene.  For example, I think many apps could hold the entire terms
dict in RAM, either at the multi-reader level or maybe per-segment
(mapping to file offset or to something else custom to the app), which
may possibly be a good speedup for certain MTQs (though, because the
format is packed into a byte[], there is a decode cost when visiting
arcs).

The builder can also prune as it goes, so you get a prefix trie pruned
according to how many terms run through the nodes, which makes it
faster and even less memory consuming.  This may be useful as a
replacement for our current binary search terms index since it can
achieve higher term density for the same RAM consumption of our
current index.

As an initial usage to make sure this is exercised, I cutover the
SimpleText codec, which currently fully loads all terms into a
TreeMap (and has caused intermittent OOME in some tests), to use an FST
instead.  SimpleText uses a PairOutputs which is able to ""pair up"" any
two other outputs, since it needs to map each input term to an int
docFreq and long filePosition.

All tests pass w/ SimpleText forced codec, and I think this is
committable except I'd love to get some help w/ the generics
(confession to the policeman: I had to add
@SuppressWarnings({""unchecked""})) all over!!  Ideally an FST is
parameterized by its output type (Integer, BytesRef, etc.).

I even added a new @nightly test that makes a largeish set of random
terms and tests the resulting FST on different outputs :)

I think it would also be easy to make a variant that uses char[]
instead of byte[] as its inputs, so we could eg use this during analysis
(Robert's idea).  It's already be easy to have a CharSequence
output type since the outputs are pluggable.

0,"Optimize refresh operations With the current implementation (recursive) refresh operations cause a full traversal of the sub-tree rooted at the item causing the refresh. This is potentially expensive. 

Instead of invalidating each item in the respective sub-tree I propose to mark the root of the sub-tree as invalidated. Such a mark would include a time stamp. Also individual items would be time stamped with their resolution time. When an item is accessed, it would check if its resolution time stamp is older than the latest invalidation time stamp. If so, it checks whether the invalidation applies to it at all (by traversing up the path) and if so it would re-resolve itself. In any case its resolution time stamp will be updated.

This approach would make invalidation much cheaper without putting much additional load to simple item access. Moreover most of the additional load (traversing up the path) only applies when an invalidation is pending."

while the concept of command chains offers a lot of flexibility, it showed that the implementation generates some drawbacks. a new mechanism should take advantage of the experiences made with the command chains.

from my point of view the following issues should be taken into consideration:

- provide means to extend and modify the import/export logic with minimal effort

- consistent import/export functionality for both collections and non-collections
  > export/import should not be completely separated.
  > interfaces should encourage consistency
  > increase maintainability, reduce no of errors

- distinction of collections and non-collections for import/export behaviour
  > PUT must result in non-coll, MKCOL in collection

- allow to defined a set of import/export-handlers with a given order.

- the different handlers must not rely on each other.

- an import/export should be completed after the first handler indicates success. there 
  should not be other classes involved in order to complete the import/export.

- avoid huge configuration files and if possible, avoid program flow being defined outside of java code.

- avoid duplicate configuration (e.g. resource-filtering), duplicate code, duplicate logic, that is 
  hard to maintain.

- additonal logic should be defined within a given import/export handler.
  however, in case of webdav i see limited value of using extra logic such as addMixin or checkin, 
  that are covered by  webdav methods (such as LOCK, VERSION-CONTROL or CHECKIN).

0,"On missing child node, automatically remove the entry (when a session attribute is set)If a node points to a non-existing child node (which is a repository inconsistency), currently this child node is silently ignored for read operations (as far as I can tell). However, when trying to add another child node with the same name, an exception is thrown with a message saying a child node with this name already exists. Also, the parent node can't be removed.

One solution is to remove the bad child node entry, but only if the session attribute ""org.apache.jackrabbit.autoFixCorruptions"" is set (so by default the repository is not changed 'secretly'):

    SimpleCredentials cred = new SimpleCredentials(...);
    cred.setAttribute(""org.apache.jackrabbit.autoFixCorruptions"", ""true"");
    rep.login(cred);

It's not a perfect solution, but it might be better than throwing an exception and basically preventing changes.

Another solution (not implemented) would be to rename the missing child node entry when trying to add a child node with the same name (for example add the current date/time, or a random digit until there is no conflict), and then continue with adding the new child node.

I did some profile testing with the new ConjuctionScorer in 2.1 and discovered a new bottleneck in ConjunctionScorer.sortScorers. The java.utils.Arrays.sort method is cloning the Scorers array on every sort, which is quite expensive on large indexes because of the size of the 'norms' array within, and isn't necessary. 

Here is one possible solution:

  private void sortScorers() {
// squeeze the array down for the sort
//    if (length != scorers.length) {
//      Scorer[] temps = new Scorer[length];
//      System.arraycopy(scorers, 0, temps, 0, length);
//      scorers = temps;
//    }
    insertionSort( scorers,length );
    // note that this comparator is not consistent with equals!
//    Arrays.sort(scorers, new Comparator() {         // sort the array
//        public int compare(Object o1, Object o2) {
//          return ((Scorer)o1).doc() - ((Scorer)o2).doc();
//        }

  private void swap(Object[] x, int a, int b) {
    Object t = x[a];
    x[a] = x[b];
    x[b] = t;
  }
 
The squeezing of the array is no longer needed. 
We also initialized the Scorers array to 8 (instead of 2) to avoid having to grow the array for common queries, although this probably has less performance impact.

This change added about 3% to query throughput in my testing.

Here's another idea:

introduce a method ChildInfo[] NodeInfo.getChildInfos(). The method either returns:

- all child infos, which also gives the correct number of child nodes. this may also mean that an empty array is returned to indicate there are no child nodes.
- null, to indicate that there are *lots* of child nodes and the method RepositoryService.getChildInfos() with the iterator should be used.

0,"Add CharArrayMap to lucene and make CharAraySet an proxy on the keySet() of itThis patch adds a CharArrayMap<V> to Lucene's analysis package as compagnon of CharArraySet. It supports fast retrieval of char[] keys like CharArraySet does. This is important for some stemmers and other places in Lucene.

Stemers generally use CharArrayMap<String>, which has then get(char[]) returning String. Strings are compact and can be easily copied into termBuffer. A Map<String,String> would be slow as the termBuffer would be first converted to String, then looked up. The return value as String is perfectly legal, as it can be copied easily into termBuffer.

This class borrows lots of code from Solr's pendant, but has additional features and more consistent API according to CharArraySet. The key is always <?>, because as of CharArraySet, anything that has a toString() representation can be used as key (of course with overhead). It also defines a unmodifiable map and correct iterators (returning the native char[]).

CharArraySet was made consistent and now returns for matchVersion>=3.1 also an iterator on char[]. CharArraySet's code was almost completely copied to CharArrayMap and removed in the Set. CharArraySet is now a simple proxy on the keySet().

In future we can think of making CharArraySet/CharArrayMap/CharArrayCollection an interface so the whole API would be more consistent to the Java collections API. But this would be a backwards break. But it would be possible to use better impl instead of hashing (like prefix trees)."

0,"Replacing mixin type doesn't preserve propertiesNodeImpl.setPrimaryType(String) attempts to ""redefine"" nodes and properties that were defined by the previous node type if they also appear in the new type. If there is no matching definition for a node/property in the new type - or value conversion for matched node/property fails - only then are children removed. For example, say I have a node ""harry"", with a primary type ""Human"" that defines a ""bloodgroup"" property. If I set the primary type to be an unrelated type ""Animal"" that has a similar ""bloodgroup"" property, then its property value will survive the call to setPrimaryType(""Animal"").

The same is apparently not possible with mixins. NodeImpl.removeMixin(Name) immediately removes all children that were defined by the mixin (strictly, those that are not present in the effective node type resulting from the mixin being removed). In addition, NodeImpl.addMixin(Name) immediately throws a NodeTypeConflictException if you attempt to add a mixin defining an identically-named property prior to calling removeMixin. For example, say I have a node ""matrix"", with a mixin type ""movie"" that defines a ""title"" property. If I wish to replace the ""movie"" mixin on that node with another ""jcr:title"" mixin type, the existing ""title"" property will be deleted.

This occurs regardless of the order in which removeMixin and addMixin are called, and without session.save() being called between them. One option for coding this is to defer validation (and possible node/property removal) until session.save() is called.

This is not strictly a bug, as JSR-283 seems to leave the details of assigning node types (section 5.5) unspecified. However, it does say for Node.removeMixin(String) that ""Both the semantic change in effective node type and the persistence of the
change to the jcr:mixinTypes property occur on save"" and ideally we could emulate the nice behaviour in NodeImpl.setPrimaryType(String) for mixin types."
1,"OOM erros with CheckIndex with indexes containg a lot of fields with normsAll index readers have a cache of the last used norms (SegmentReader, MultiReader, MultiSegmentReader,...). This cache is never cleaned up, so if you access norms of a field, the norm's byte[maxdoc()] array is not freed until you close/reopen the index.

You can see this problem, if you create an index with many fields with norms (I tested with about 4,000 fields) and many documents (half a million). If you then call CheckIndex, that calls norms() for each (!) field in the Segment and each of this calls creates a new cache entry, you get OutOfMemoryExceptions after short time (I tested with the above index: I was not able to do a CheckIndex even with ""-Xmx 16GB"" on 64bit Java).

CheckIndex opens and then tests each segment of a index with a separate SegmentReader. The big index with the OutOfMemory problem was optimized, so consisting of one segment with about half a million docs and about 4,000 fields. Each byte[] array takes about a half MiB for this index. The CheckIndex funtion created the norm for 4000 fields and the SegmentReader cached them, which is about 2 GiB RAM. So OOMs are not unusal.

In my opinion, the best would be to use a Weak- or better a SoftReference so norms.bytes gets java.lang.ref.SoftReference<byte[]> and used for caching. With proper synchronization (which is done on the norms cache in SegmentReader) you can do the best with SoftReference, as this reference is garbage collected only when an OOM may happen. If the byte[] array is freed (but it is only freed if no other references exist), a lter call to getNorms() creates a new array. When code is hard referencing the norms array, it will not be freed, so no problem. The same could be done for the other IndexReaders.

Fields without norm() do not have this problem, as all these fields share a one-time allocated dummy norm array. So the same index without norms enabled for most of the fields checked perfectly.

I will prepare a patch tomorrow.

Mike proposed another quick fix for CheckIndex:
bq. we could do something first specifically for CheckIndex (eg it could simply use the 3-arg non-caching bytes method instead) to prevent OOM errors when using it.

Obviously both may not be satisfied, and therefore we will guarantee that if there is any segment above the threshold, the threshold constraint takes precedence and therefore you may end up w/ <maxNumSegments (if it's not 1) after optimize. Otherwise, maxNumSegments is taken into consideration.

Proposed flow:

1) Review the maven specific elements in the zip:
- project.xml, header.txt, license.txt, notice.txt, checkstyle.xml, project.properties, xdocs directory. NOTE: I know the license.txt and maybe header.txt are not correct per earlier discussions.
2) Once new package layout/code is in svn - we can refactor this and move the maven related files into place.

Thoughts,
  a) One of the artifacts generated is the bat file and supporting directory with the jar to run the sample app - could use some ideas on how maven should generate this.
  b) How the local maven repo gets the jcr-api.jar? My current thinking is 'same as any non-redistributable artifact'. The user is responsible for downloading it to a local repository."

Subject: Fuzzy makes no sense for short tokens
Date: Mon, 31 Dec 2007 16:01:11 +0100
Message-Id: <200712311601.12255.lucene@nitwit.de>

Hi!

it generally makes no sense to search fuzzy for short tokens because changing
even only a single character of course already results in a high edit
distance. So it actually only makes sense in this case:

           if( token.length() > 1f / (1f - minSimilarity) )

E.g. changing one character in a 3-letter token (foo) results in an edit
distance of 0.6. And if minSimilarity (which is by default: 0.5 :-) is higher
we can save all the expensive rewrite() logic.
{noformat}

I don't know much about FuzzyQueries, but this reasoning seems sound ... FuzzyQuery.rewrite should be able to completely skip all TermEnumeration in the event that the input token is shorter then some simple math on the minSimilarity.  (i'm not smart enough to be certain that the math above is right however ... it's been a while since i looked at Levenstein distances ... tests needed)

0,"Speed up hierarchy cache initializationInitializing a workspace can take quite a long time if there is a big number of nodes and some search indexes involved. The reason is that the setup of the CachingIndexReader is processed using chunks of a certain size (actually 400K) in order to reduce the memory footprint. As soon as the number of documents exceeds this limit some operations (actually traversing complete indexes) are performed again and again.

It seems that the current algorithm ""initializeParents"" in the CachingIndexReader class can't be optimized without increasing the memory consumption. Therefore it should be a promising approach to persist the ""state"" of this class (actually it's main member array and map) and reload it on startup.

The ""load"" of the state can be done implicitly in the initializing phase of the cache. This is obvious. The correct point of time to call the ""save"" operation isn't obvious at all. I tried the ""doClose"" method of the class and it seems sufficient."

0,"Provide access to port of Host headerWe use a load balancer that connects to the HTTP server and the HTTP server
connects to the application server. We use port translation in our load
balancer. So when e.g. a client connects to 90 of the load balancer, the load
balancer connects to port 100 of the HTTP server. The load balancer doesn't
change the Host request header, so in the host request header is still the
original virtual host name and port, in this case port 90. For this reason, the
virtual hosts of the HTTP server and application server are configured based on
the external port numbers, so in this case port 90.
 
For test purposes, we sometimes want to connect directly to the HTTP server or
the application server, bypassing the load balancer. To do this, we need to
connect to the same port as the load balancer would, in this example port 100,
but the host header of this request should be the same as if the request would
go through the load balancer, so in this example port 90, because the HTTP
server and application server's virtual hosts are configured for this port.

The attached patch adds the possibility to specify the port number for virtual
hosts.

Here's a code snippet that uses the patched code:

HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
HttpMethod method = new GetMethod();
HostConfiguration hostConfiguration = new HostConfiguration();
hostConfiguration.setHost(""localhost"", 80, ""http"");
HostParams params = new HostParams();
params.setVirtualHost(""localhost"");

Furthermore, there are the following confusing existing issues:
* scorePayload should take bytesref
* PayloadTermScorer passes a *null* byte[] array to the sim if there are no payloads. I don't think it should do this, and its inconsistent with PayloadNearQuery, which does not do this. Its an undocumented conditional you need to have in the scoring algorithm which we should remove.
* there is an unused constant for scorepayload (NO_DOC_ID_PROVIDED), which is a documented, but never used anywhere.

1,"Explanation.toHtml outputs invalid HTMLIf you want an HTML representation of an Explanation, you might call the toHtml() method.  However, the output of this method looks like the following:

    <li>some nested value = some description</li>

As it is illegal in HTML to nest a UL directly inside a UL, this method will always output unparseable HTML if there are nested explanations.

0,"optional normsFor applications with many indexed fields, the norms cause memory problems both during indexing and querying.
This patch makes norms optional on a per-field basis, in the same way that term vectors are optional per-field.

Overview of changes:
 - Field.omitNorms that defaults to false
 - backward compatible lucene file format change: FieldInfos.FieldBits has a bit for omitNorms
 - IndexReader.hasNorms() method
 - During merging, if any segment includes norms, then norms are included.
 - methods to get norms return the equivalent 1.0f array for backward compatibility

The patch was designed for backward compatibility:
 - all current unit tests pass w/o any modifications required
 - compatible with old indexes since the default is omitNorms=false
 - compatible with older/custom subclasses of IndexReader since a default hasNorms() is provided
 - compatible with older/custom users of IndexReader such as Weight/Scorer/explain since a norm array is produced on demand, even if norms were not stored

If this patch is accepted (or if the direction is acceptable), performance for scoring  could be improved by assuming 1.0f when hasNorms(field)==false.

0,"add getFinalOffset() to TokenStreamIf you add multiple Fieldable instances for the same field name to a document, and you then index those fields with TermVectors storing offsets, it's very likely the offsets for all but the first field instance will be wrong.

This is because IndexWriter under the hood adds a cumulative base to the offsets of each field instance, where that base is 1 + the endOffset of the last token it saw when analyzing that field.

But this logic is overly simplistic.  For example, if the WhitespaceAnalyzer is being used, and the text being analyzed ended in 3 whitespace characters, then that information is lost and then next field's offsets are then all 3 too small.  Similarly, if a StopFilter appears in the chain, and the last N tokens were stop words, then the base will be 1 + the endOffset of the last non-stopword token.

To fix this, I'd like to add a new getFinalOffset() to TokenStream.  I'm thinking by default it returns -1, which means ""I don't know so you figure it out"", meaning we fallback to the faulty logic we have today.

This has come up several times on the user's list."

0,"Add utitily class to manage NRT reopeningI created a simple class, NRTManager, that tries to abstract away some
of the reopen logic when using NRT readers.

You give it your IW, tell it min and max nanoseconds staleness you can
tolerate, and it privately runs a reopen thread to periodically reopen
the searcher.

It subsumes the SearcherManager from LIA2.  Besides running the reopen
thread, it also adds the notion of a ""generation"" containing changes
you've made.  So eg it has addDocument, returning a long.  You can
then take that long value and pass it back to the getSearcher method
and getSearcher will return a searcher that reflects the changes made
in that generation.

This gives your app the freedom to force ""immediate"" consistency (ie
wait for the reopen) only for those searches that require it, like a
verifier that adds a doc and then immediately searches for it, but
also use ""eventual consistency"" for other searches.

I want to also add support for the new ""applyDeletions"" option when
pulling an NRT reader.

Also, this is very new and I'm sure buggy -- the concurrency is either
wrong over overly-locking.  But it's a start...

Issues:
1. JavaDoc is insufficient, leading one to read the code to figure out how to use the class.
2. Deprecations are incomplete. The constructors that take String as an argument and the methods that take and/or return String should *all* be deprecated.
3. The allocation policy is too aggressive. With large tokens the resulting buffer can be over-allocated. A less aggressive algorithm would be better. In the thread, the Python example is good as it is computationally simple.
4. The parts of the code that currently use Token's deprecated methods can be upgraded now rather than waiting for 3.0. As it stands, filter chains that alternate between char[] and String are sub-optimal. Currently, it is used in core by Query classes. The rest are in contrib, mostly in analyzers.
5. Some internal optimizations can be done with regard to char[] allocation.
6. TokenStream has next() and next(Token), next() should be deprecated, so that reuse is maximized and descendant classes should be rewritten to over-ride next(Token)
7. Tokens are often stored as a String in a Term. It would be good to add constructors that took a Token. This would simplify the use of the two together.

0,"Large fetch sizes have potentially deleterious effects on VM memory requirements when using OracleSince Release 10g, Oracle JDBC drivers use the fetch size to allocate buffers for caching row data.
cf. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/enterprise-edition/memory.pdf

This value has significant, potentially deleterious, effects on the heap space required for even moderately-sized repositories. For example, the BUNDLE table (from 'oracle.ddl') has two columns -- NODE_ID raw(16) and BUNDLE_DATA blob -- which require 16 b and 4 kb of buffer space, respectively. This requires a buffer of more than 40 mb [(16+4096) * 10000 = 41120000].

I tracked down the issue to the implementation of MultiTermDocs.skipTo function (found in MultiReader.java).  Optimized indexes do not use this class during search but unoptimized indexes do.  The comment on this function even explicitly states 'As yet unoptimized implementation.'  It was implemented just by calling 'next' over and over so even if it knew it could skip ahead hundreds of thousands of hits it would not.

So I re-implemented the function very similar to how the MultiTermDocs.next function was implemented and tested it out on or application for correctness and performance and it passed all our tests and the performance penalty of having multiple segments vanished.

Currently, if stopScan() is not called, an exception is thrown. This is not user friendly. Instead, stopScan() should be optional, and should be allowed any time. It may be used to indicate garbage collection has finished:

try {
  gc.scan();
  ...
  gc.deleteUnused();
} finally {
  gc.stopScan();
}

Or when sharing the repository:

gc1.scan();
gc2.scan();
gc1.deleteUnused();
gc2.stopScan();

0,"Use hash codes instead of sequence numbers for string indexesWe use index numbers instead of namespace URIs or other strings in many places. The two-way mapping between namespace URIs and index numbers is by default stored in the repository-global ns_idx.properties file, and the index numbers are allocated using a linear sequence. The problem with this approach is that two repositories will easily end up with different string index mappings, which makes it practically impossible to make low-level copies of workspace content across repositories.

The ultimate solution for this problem would be to store the namespace URIs closer to the stored content, ideally as an implementation detail of a persistence manager.

An easier short-term solution would be to decrease the chances of two repositories having different string index mappings. A simple (and backwards-compatible) way to do this is to use the hash code of a namespace URI as the basis of allocating a new index number. Hash collisions are fairly unlikely, and can be handled by incrementing the intial hash code until the collision is avoided. In the common case of no collisions (with a uniform hash function the chance of a collision is less than 1% even with tousands of registered namespaces) this solution allows workspaces to be copied between repositories without worrying about the namespace index mappings."

1,"NodeIdImpl is not really serializable I've been trying to get jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr to work. 

The error I'm seeing is reported as:
java.io.NotSerializableException: org.apache.jackrabbit.spi.commons.identifier.IdFactoryImpl

I believe I tracked this down.  It is because NodeIdImpl is implicitly referencing its containing instance IdFactoryImpl which is not serializable.

NodeIdImpl is attempted to be serialized, in my case, with the following stack:

I think I must be doing something wrong, because it seems like this is a fundamental problem with doing jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr, and looking at the SVN history I don't see how this ever could have worked.  
So either session.getRootNode() has never been tested using jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr, or I've got something setup wrong."
1,"Duplicate request headers when connect through proxiesWhen negotiating proxy servers or during write-failure retries, the httpClient 
adds duplicate request headers to each retry.  The result is that each header 
is duplicated multiple times (number of retries).  This only impact the headers 
that allow multiple values (the others were prevented byt the code).  In  
Particular, it affects ""cookie"" header.  It happens more often when going 
through proxy server with tunnelling connections (https), but also happens on 
http on NTLM proxy server (need multiple round trips to get authenticated).

Steps to Reproduce:
Setup a client application to go to a website that requires going through a 
proxy server that supports tunnelling for https connections and authenticate 
users (Basic and/or NTLM).  The website also need to support keep-alive and 
support https. Initilize the HttpState with a cookie. Turn httpClient 
logging ""wire, debug and trace"" logging on.  Set the proxy credential with 
valid user id and password.

Then run the application against any url on the website.

Test Results and fixes:
1. When connect to https through a (Netscape/Basic auth) proxy that does 
the ""tunnelling"", the initial ""CONNECT"" adds the cookie header once.  The proxy 
returns the 407.  Then the code will use the proxy credential to do 
the ""CONNECT"" again.  After successful connection (200), the code will do the 
proper ""POST"".  The httpClient code adds the same cookie one more time in here.

This case was caused by the wrapper class ConnectMethod using the wrapped 
method ""addRequestHeaders"" to build headers for the ""CONENCT"".  It can be fixed 
by having the ConnectMethod only adds headers it needs (""addHostRequestHeader"" 
and ""addProxyAuthorizationRequestHeader"").

2. When connect to http through proxy.  The client first sends a ""POST"" without 
proxy credentials, and gets a 407 back.  The cookie header is added before that 
happens.  Then (loop in the HttpMethodBase.execute) the client will retry 
the ""POST"" with the credentials (the logic require to have a response header to 
submit credentials).  In the retry, the cookie is added again 
(addRequestHeaders is called inside the writeRequest).

3. When using kee-alive with no-proxy on http, if the connection times out, the 
next call of the method will get a socket error on write.  The retry loop in 
the processRequest method will retry the request again.  It will add the cookie 
again.  To deal with both case 2 and 3, the addRequestHeadres call need to be 
moved up to the beginning of the HttpMethodBase.execute.  We tested this 
approach and it worked for us.

4. When negotiating NTLM proxy for https, multiple round trips are needed to 
get user authenticated.  The same ConnectMethod instance is used.  So the 
adding of the proxy authenticate headers need to be done with the ConnectMethod 
instance (vs. the wrapped method for Host header).  Otherwise, the 
Authenticator class would not be able to find the information for 
authenticating user.


I will send in our suggested fixes later.

0,"improve BaseTokenStreamTestCase to test end()If offsetAtt/end() is not implemented correctly, then there can be problems with highlighting: see LUCENE-2207 for an example with CJKTokenizer.

In my opinion you currently have to write too much code to test this.

This patch does the following:
* adds optional Integer finalOffset (can be null for no checking) to assertTokenStreamContents
* in assertAnalyzesTo, automatically fill this with the String length()

In my opinion this is correct, for assertTokenStreamContents the behavior should be optional, it may not even have a Tokenizer. If you are using assertTokenStreamContents with a Tokenizer then simply provide the extra expected value to check it.

for assertAnalyzesTo then it is implied there is a tokenizer so it should be checked.

the tests pass for core but there are failures in contrib even besides CJKTokenizer (apply Koji's patch from LUCENE-2207, it is correct). Specifically ChineseTokenizer has a similar problem.

    This document has errors that must be fixed before
    using HTML Tidy to generate a tidied up version.

The solution is to configure Tidy to accept these abnormal tags by adding the tag name to the ""new-inline-tags"" option in the Tidy config file (or the command line which does not make sense in this context), like so:

0,"IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse setupSetting up Lucene/Solr in IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse can be time-consuming.

The attached patches add a new top level directory {{dev-tools/}} with sub-dirs {{idea/}} and {{eclipse/}} containing basic setup files for trunk, as well as top-level ant targets named ""idea"" and ""eclipse"" that copy these files into the proper locations.  This arrangement avoids the messiness attendant to in-place project configuration files directly checked into source control.

The IDEA configuration includes modules for Lucene and Solr, each Lucene and Solr contrib, and each analysis module.  A JUnit run configuration per module is included.

The Eclipse configuration includes a source entry for each source/test/resource location and classpath setup: a library entry for each jar.

For IDEA, once {{ant idea}} has been run, the only configuration that must be performed manually is configuring the project-level JDK.  For Eclipse, once {{ant eclipse}} has been run, the user has to refresh the project (right-click on the project and choose Refresh).

If these patches is committed, Subversion svn:ignore properties should be added/modified to ignore the destination IDEA and Eclipse configuration locations.

0,"2.1 Locking documentation in ""Apache Lucene - Index File Formats"" section ""6.2 Lock File"" out datedI am in the process to migrate from Lucene 2.0 to Lucene 2.1.

From reading the Changes document I understand that the write locks are now written into the index folder instead of the java.io.tmpdir. 

In the ""Apache Lucene - Index File Formats"" document in section ""6.2 Lock File"" I read that there is a write lock used to indicate that another process is writing into the index and that this file is stored in the java.io.tempdir.

This is confusing to me.  I had the impression all lock files go into the index folder now.  And using the the java.io.tempdir is only local and does not support access to shared index folders.

Do I miss something here or is the documentation not updated?

0,"SecureProtocolFactoryWrapper class for using the socket factory created by Java Web StartAs smartcards and SSL are becoming more and more prevelant, Java Web Start has started to become better equiped to handle these situations.

0,"Rename GenericRepositoryFactory to JndiRepositoryFactoryThe GenericRepositoryFactory class introduced in JCR-2360 has since been refactored so that most of its functionality is now distributed among the more implementation-specific RepositoryFactory classes. Now the GenericRepositoryFactory only contains support for looking the repository up in JNDI, so it would be better to rename the class to JndiRepositoryFactory.

The only troublesome part of the rename is the GenericRepositoryFactory.URI constant that was for a while documented on our wiki as a part of the canonical code snippet for accessing a remote repository based on the repository URI. The latest recommendation is to use the JcrUtils.getRepository(String uri) method so the constant is no longer needed in client code, but for backwards compatibility with earlier Jackrabbit 2.0 betas it may be good to keep the deprecated constant for at least the next beta release."

0,"Provide a clean mechanism to attatch user define attributes to connectionsIt would be nice to have a way to attach user defined attributes to a connection.
Ideally it'd be nice if such support could be added to HttpClientConnection, but understandably this may not be possible due to back-compatibility issues.
So, we could have something like HttpConnectionContext perhaps (or similar) with:

HttpConnectionContext#setAttribute(String name, Object value)
Object HttpConnectionContext#getAttribute(String name)

This would be made available in the HttpContext of a request (like the connection is today):

HttpConnectionContext connectionContext = (HttpConnectionContext) httpContext.getAttribute(ExecutionContext.HTTP_CONNECTION_CONTEXT);

This would make a few things much cleaner to implement than they are today: The most obvious being my current use case of wanting connection isolated cookies.

Currently to achieve this goal we need to provide custom client connection + connection operator + connection manager implementations. Then there is no clean way to currently obtain the actual connection instance created by a custom operator in the HttpContext: As it's wrapped by the connection pool and #getWrappedConnection is protected - so we need to resort to reflection in interceptors.

Providing a clean mechanism for attaching user defined attributes to a connection instance as described above would make such implementations far far simpler.

feedback.  All tests pass, though back compat tests don't pass due to

which the new API asserts against).

[Aside: I think, when we commit changes to package-private APIs such
that back-compat tests don't pass, we could go back, make a branch on
the back-compat tag, commit changes to the tests to use the new
package private APIs on that branch, then fix nightly build to use the
tip of that branch?o]

There's still plenty to do before this is committable! This is a
rather large change:

  * Switches to a new more efficient terms dict format.  This still
    uses tii/tis files, but the tii only stores term & long offset
    (not a TermInfo).  At seek points, tis encodes term & freq/prox
    offsets absolutely instead of with deltas delta.  Also, tis/tii
    are structured by field, so we don't have to record field number
    in every term.
.
    On first 1 M docs of Wikipedia, tii file is 36% smaller (0.99 MB
    -> 0.64 MB) and tis file is 9% smaller (75.5 MB -> 68.5 MB).
.
    RAM usage when loading terms dict index is significantly less
    since we only load an array of offsets and an array of String (no
    more TermInfo array).  It should be faster to init too.
.
    This part is basically done.

  * Introduces modular reader codec that strongly decouples terms dict
    from docs/positions readers.  EG there is no more TermInfo used
    when reading the new format.
.
    There's nice symmetry now between reading & writing in the codec
    chain -- the current docs/prox format is captured in:
{code}
FormatPostingsTermsDictWriter/Reader
FormatPostingsDocsWriter/Reader (.frq file) and
FormatPostingsPositionsWriter/Reader (.prx file).
{code}
    This part is basically done.

  * Introduces a new ""flex"" API for iterating through the fields,
    terms, docs and positions:
{code}
FieldProducer -> TermsEnum -> DocsEnum -> PostingsEnum
{code}
    This replaces TermEnum/Docs/Positions.  SegmentReader emulates the
    old API on top of the new API to keep back-compat.
    
Next steps:

  * Plug in new codecs (pulsing, pfor) to exercise the modularity /
    fix any hidden assumptions.

  * Expose new API out of IndexReader, deprecate old API but emulate
    old API on top of new one, switch all core/contrib users to the
    new API.

  * Maybe switch to AttributeSources as the base class for TermsEnum,
    DocsEnum, PostingsEnum -- this would give readers API flexibility
    (not just index-file-format flexibility).  EG if someone wanted
    to store payload at the term-doc level instead of
    term-doc-position level, you could just add a new attribute.

  * Test performance & iterate.

0,"Automatic repository shutdownCurrently Jackrabbit relies on two mechanisms for safely shutting down a repository:

    1) client application invoking RepositoryImpl.shutdown(), or
    2) the shutdown hook installed by RepositoryImpl being run

Both of these mechanisms have problems:

    1) The shutdown() method is not a part of the JCR API, thus making the client application depend on a Jackrabbit-specific feature
    2) In some cases the shutdown hook is not properly run (see issues JCR-120 and JCR-233)

I think the JCR spec thinks of the Repository and Session interfaces as being somewhat similar to the JDBC DataSource and Connection interfaces. The Repository instances have no real lifecycle methods while the Session instances have clearly specified login and logout steps. (DataSource.getConnection() = Repository.login(), Session.logout() = Connection.close()) However the Jackrabbit implementation defines an explicit lifecycle for the RepositoryImpl instances.

This causes problems especially for container environments (JNDI, Spring) where it is hard or even impossible to specify a shutdown mechanism for resource factories like the Repository instances. The current solution for such environments is to use a shutdown hook, but as reported this solution does not work perfectly in all cases.

How about if we bound the RepositoryImpl lifecycle to the lifecycles of the instantiated Sessions. A RepositoryImpl instance could initialize (and lock) the repository when the first session is opened and automatically shut down when the last session has logged out. As long as the sessions are properly logged out (or finalized by the garbage collector) there would be no need for an explicitly RepositoryImpl.shutdown() call. The current behaviour of pre-initializing the repository and shutting down during a shutdown hook could be enabled with a configuration option for environments (like global JNDI resources) in which the shutdown hooks work well.

Another feature is getFileName() to get the file name if it is stored in the file system.

{code:title=indexing a multiValued field}
doc.add( new Field( F, ""Mike"", Store.YES, Index.ANALYZED, TermVector.WITH_OFFSETS ) );
doc.add( new Field( F, ""will"", Store.YES, Index.ANALYZED, TermVector.WITH_OFFSETS ) );

doc.add( new Field( F, ""Lucene"", Store.YES, Index.ANALYZED, TermVector.WITH_OFFSETS ) );

In this program (soon to be attached), if you use WhitespaceAnalyzer, you'll get the offset(start,end) for ""use"" and ""Lucene"" will be use(10,13) and Lucene(14,20). But if you use StopAnalyzer, the offsets will be use(9,12) and lucene(13,19). When searching, since searcher cannot know what analyzer was used at indexing time, this problem causes out of alignment of FVH.

Cause of the problem: StopAnalyzer filters out ""will"", anyToken flag set to false then offset gap is not added in DocInverterPerField:

{code:title=DocInverterPerField.java}
if (anyToken)
  fieldState.offset += docState.analyzer.getOffsetGap(field);

0,"IOUtils.closeSafely should log suppressed Exceptions in stack trace of original Exception (a new feature of Java 7)I was always against Java 6 support, as it brings no really helpful new features into Lucene. But there are several things that make life easier in coming Java 7 (hopefully on July 28th, 2011). One of those is simplier Exception handling and suppression on Closeable, called ""Try-With-Resources"" (see http://docs.google.com/View?id=ddv8ts74_3fs7483dp, by the way all Lucene classes support these semantics in Java 7 automatically, the cool try-code below would work e.g. for IndexWriter, TokenStreams,...).

We already have this functionality in Lucene since adding the IOUtils.closeSafely() utility (which can be removed when Java 7 is the minimum requirement of Lucene - maybe in 10 years):

{code:java}
try (Closeable a = new ...; Closeable b = new ...) {
  ... use Closeables ...
} catch (Exception e) {
  dosomething;
  throw e;
}
{code}

This code will close a and b in an autogenerated finally block and supress any exception. This is identical to our IOUtils.closeSafely:

{code:java}
Exception priorException = null;
Closeable a,b;
try (Closeable a = new ...; Closeable b = new ...) {
  a = new ...;
  b = new ...
  ... use Closeables ...
} catch (Exception e) {
  priorException = e;
  dosomething;
} finally {
  IOUtils.closeSafely(priorException, a, b);
}
{code}

So this means we have the same functionality without Java 7, but there is one thing that makes logging/debugging much nicer:
The above Java 7 code also adds maybe suppressed Exceptions in those Closeables to the priorException, so when you print the stacktrace, it not only shows the stacktrace of the original Exception, it also prints all Exceptions that were suppressed to throw this Exception (all Closeable.close() failures):

For this in Java 7 a new method was added to Throwable, that allows logging such suppressed Exceptions (it is called automatically by the synthetic bytecode emitted by javac). This patch simply adds this functionality conditionally to IOUtils, so it ""registers"" all suppressed Exceptions, if running on Java 7. This is done by reflection: once it looks for this method in Throwable.class and if found, it invokes it in closeSafely, so the exceptions thrown on Closeable.close() don't get lost.

This makes debugging much easier and logs all problems that may occur.

This patch does *not* change functionality or behaviour, it just adds more nformation to the stack trace in a Java-7-way (similar to the way how Java 1.4 added causes). It works here locally on Java 6 and Java 7, but only Java 7 gets the additional stack traces. For Java 6 nothing changes. Same for Java 5 (if we backport to 3.x).

This would be our first Java 7 improvement (a minor one). Next would be NIO2... - but thats not easy to do with reflection only, so we have to wait 10 years :-)"

0,"core analyzers should not produce tokens > N (100?) characters in lengthDiscussion that led to this:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/56103

I believe nearly any time a token > 100 characters in length is
produced, it's a bug in the analysis that the user is not aware of.

These long tokens cause all sorts of problems, downstream, so it's
best to catch them early at the source.

We can accomplish this by tacking on a LengthFilter onto the chains
for StandardAnalyzer, SimpleAnalyzer, WhitespaceAnalyzer, etc.

Should we do this in 2.3?  I realize this is technically a break in
backwards compatibility, however, I think it must be incredibly rare
that this break would in fact break something real in the application?"

0,"if a filter can support random access API, we should use itI ran some performance tests, comparing applying a filter via
random-access API instead of current trunk's iterator API.

This was inspired by LUCENE-1476, where we realized deletions should
really be implemented just like a filter, but then in testing found
that switching deletions to iterator was a very sizable performance
hit.

Some notes on the test:

  * Index is first 2M docs of Wikipedia.  Test machine is Mac OS X
    10.5.6, quad core Intel CPU, 6 GB RAM, java 1.6.0_07-b06-153.

  * I test across multiple queries.  1-X means an OR query, eg 1-4
    means 1 OR 2 OR 3 OR 4, whereas +1-4 is an AND query, ie 1 AND 2
    AND 3 AND 4.  ""u s"" means ""united states"" (phrase search).

  * I test with multiple filter densities (0, 1, 2, 5, 10, 25, 75, 90,
    95, 98, 99, 99.99999 (filter is non-null but all bits are set),
    100 (filter=null, control)).

  * Method high means I use random-access filter API in
    IndexSearcher's main loop.  Method low means I use random-access
    filter API down in SegmentTermDocs (just like deleted docs
    today).

  * Baseline (QPS) is current trunk, where filter is applied as iterator up
    ""high"" (ie in IndexSearcher's search loop)."

1,"hotspot bug in readvint gives wrong resultsWhen testing the 3.1-RC1 made by Yonik on the PANGAEA (www.pangaea.de) productive system I figured out that suddenly on a large segment (about 5 GiB) some stored fiels suddenly produce a strange deflate decompression problem (CompressionTools) although the stored fields are no longer pre-3.0 compressed. It seems that the header of the stored field is read incorrectly at the buffer boundary in MultiMMapDir and then FieldsReader just incorrectly detects a deflate-compressed field (CompressionTools).

The error occurs reproducible on CheckIndex with MMapDirectory, but not with NIODir or SimpleDir. The FDT file of that segment is 2.6 GiB, on Solaris the chunk size is Integer.MAX_VALUE, so we have 2 MultiMMap IndexInputs.

Robert and me have the index ready as a tar file, we will do tests on our local machines and hopefully solve the bug, maybe introduced by Robert's recent changes to MMap."
0,"Deprecation of autoCommit in 2.4 leads to compile problems, when autoCommit should be falseI am currently changing my code to be most compatible with 2.4. I switched on deprecation warnings and got a warning about the autoCommit parameter in IndexWriter constructors.

My code *should* use autoCommit=false, so I want to use the new semantics. The default of IndexWriter is still autoCommit=true. My problem now: How to disable autoCommit whithout deprecation warnings?

Maybe, the ""old"" constructors, that are deprecated should use autoCommit=true. But there are new constructors with this ""IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength mfl"" in it, that appear new in 2.4 but are deprecated:

IndexWriter(Directory d, boolean autoCommit, Analyzer a, boolean create, IndexDeletionPolicy deletionPolicy, IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength mfl) 
          Deprecated. This will be removed in 3.0, when autoCommit will be hardwired to false. Use IndexWriter(Directory,Analyzer,boolean,IndexDeletionPolicy,MaxFieldLength) instead, and call commit() when needed.

What the hell is meant by this, a new constructor that is deprecated? And the hint is wrong. If I use the other constructor in the warning, I get autoCommit=true.

There is something completely wrong.

It should be clear, which constructors set autoCommit=true, which set it per default to false (perhaps new ones), and the Deprecated text is wrong, if autoCommit does not default to false."

- If I flush manually after each addDocument() call, then the index contains more segments. But still, there are segments that contain more docs than maxMergeDocs, e. g. 55 vs. 50. The javadoc in IndexWriter says:

1,"Inconsistency between Session.getProperty and Node.getProperty for binary valuesthere an inconsistency in the binary handling between the batch-reading facility and those cases where a property is directly
accessed without having accessed the parent node before.

this issue came up with timothee maret running into performance issues when retrieving the length of a binary property:

if the property-entry has been created in the run of a batch-read operation the corresponding property-data object
contains internal values that contain the length of the binary (such as transported with the json response) and only
read the data from the server if the value stream is explicitly requested.
however, if the property is accessed directly (e.g. Session.getProperty or Node.getProperty with a relative path) 
a GET request is made to the corresponding dav resource and the stream is read immediately.

possible solution:

if RepositoryService#getItemInfos(SessionInfo, ItemId) is called with a PropertyId the implementation
should not result in a GET request to the corresponding resource by calling super.getPropertyInfo(sessionInfo, (PropertyId) itemId).
instead it should be consistent with the batch-read and only make a PROPFIND request for the property
length. the returned PropertyInfo object would in that case be identical to the one generated by the batch-read functionality.

1,"ParallelReader fails on deletes and on seeks of previously unused fieldsIn using ParallelReader I've hit two bugs:

1.  ParallelReader.doDelete() and doUndeleteAll() call doDelete() and doUndeleteAll() on the subreaders, but these methods do not set hasChanges.  Thus the changes are lost when the readers are closed.  The fix is to call deleteDocument() and undeleteAll() on the subreaders instead.

2.  ParallelReader discovers the fields in each subindex by using IndexReader.getFieldNames() which only finds fields that have occurred on at least one document.  In general a parallel index is designed with assignments of fields to sub-indexes and term seeks (including searches) may be done on any of those fields, even if no documents in a particular state of the index have yet had an assigned field.  Seeks/searches on fields that have not yet been indexed generated an NPE in ParallelReader's various inner class seek() and next() methods because fieldToReader.get() returns null on the unseen field.  The fix is to extend the add() methods to supply the correct list of fields for each subindex.

Patch that corrects both of these issues attached.

1,"NumericUtils.floatToSortableInt/doubleToSortableLong does not sort certain NaN ranges correctly and NumericRangeQuery produces wrong results for NaNs with half-open rangesThe current implementation of floatToSortableInt does not account for different NaN ranges which may result in NaNs sorted before -Infinity and after +Infinity. The default Java ordering is: all NaNs after Infinity.

A possible fix is to make all NaNs canonic ""quiet NaN"" as in:
{code}
// Canonicalize NaN ranges. I assume this check will be faster here than 
// (v == v) == false on the FPU? We don't distinguish between different
// flavors of NaNs here (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN). I guess
// in Java this doesn't matter much anyway.
if ((v & 0x7fffffff) > 0x7f800000) {
  // Apply the logic below to a canonical ""quiet NaN""
  return 0x7fc00000 ^ 0x80000000;
}

I don't commit because I don't know how much of the existing stuff relies on this (nobody should be keeping different NaNs  in their indexes, but who knows...)."
0,"Unnecessary null check in EffectiveNodeType.getApplicableChildNodeDef()This is just a trivial thing I noticed this while inspecting the code. getApplicableChildNodeDef() says:

1,"Invalid query results when using jcr:like with a case transform function and a pattern not starting with a wildcardIf the repository contains nodes with the following value for the property name :
john
JOhn
joe
Joey

and we run the following query :
//element(*, document)/*[jcr:like(fn:lower-case(@name), 'joh%')]"")
then all the previous nodes will match especially the last 2 nodes.

The reason is the use of two range scans from the lucene term index:
..._name_jOH
..................
..._name_joh_

and

..._name_JOH
..................
..._name_Joh_

The first range will contains ..._name_joe property and the second will contains ..._name_Joey.
But the pattern 'joh%' and so the regexp '.*' because of the range scan will match
the substring values of the properties ('' in the first range and 'y' in the second range).

The solution is to use the full pattern (ie 'joh.*') for matching each properties."

0,"Add unsigned packed int impls in oal.utilThere are various places in Lucene that could take advantage of an
efficient packed unsigned int/long impl.  EG the terms dict index in
the standard codec in LUCENE-1458 could subsantially reduce it's RAM
usage.  FieldCache.StringIndex could as well.  And I think ""load into
RAM"" codecs like the one in TestExternalCodecs could use this too.

I'm picturing something very basic like:
{code}
interface PackedUnsignedLongs  {
  long get(long index);
  void set(long index, long value);
}
{code}

Plus maybe an iterator for getting and maybe also for setting.  If it
helps, most of the usages of this inside Lucene will be ""write once""
so eg the set could make that an assumption/requirement.

And a factory somewhere:

{code}
  PackedUnsignedLongs create(int count, long maxValue);
{code}

I think we should simply autogen the code (we can start from the
autogen code in LUCENE-1410), or, if there is an good existing impl
that has a compatible license that'd be great.

I don't have time near-term to do this... so if anyone has the itch,
please jump!

0,"Compressed entities are not being cached properlyorg.apache.http.impl.client.cache.CacheValidityPolicy.contentLengthHeaderMatchesActualLength() returns false for entities decompressed by ContentEncodingHttpClient, because the length of decompressed entity stored in cache will be different from the length specified in the response header.
Consequently, gzipped/deflated entities will never be satisfied from the cache.

Proposed fix: introduce new field in HttpCacheEntry() - actualContentLength, and populate it with the actual content length rigth before the cache entry is stored in the cache. Change the org.apache.http.impl.client.cache.CacheValidityPolicy.contentLengthHeaderMatchesActualLength() method to compare

0,"Absorb NIOFSDirectory into FSDirectoryI think whether one uses java.io.* vs java.nio.* or eventually
java.nio2.*, or some other means, is an under-the-hood implementation
detail of FSDirectory and doesn't merit a whole separate class.

I think FSDirectory should be the core class one uses when one's index
is in the filesystem.

So, I'd like to deprecate NIOFSDirectory, absorbing it into
FSDirectory, and add a setting ""useNIO"" to FSDirectory.  It should
default to ""true"" for non-Windows OSs, because it gives far better
concurrent performance on all platforms but Windows (due to known Sun
JRE issue http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6265734).

I tried delaying the buffer allocation in BufferedIndexInput by 
using this clone() method: 
 
  public Object clone() { 
    BufferedIndexInput clone = (BufferedIndexInput)super.clone(); 
    clone.buffer = null; 
    clone.bufferLength = 0; 
    clone.bufferPosition = 0; 
    clone.bufferStart = getFilePointer();  
    return clone; 
  } 
 
With this all term document iterators seem to be empty, no 
query in the test cases gives any results, for example TestDemo 
and TestBoolean2. 
As far as I can see, this delaying should work, but it doesn't and 
I have no idea why. 
 
End of quote from java-dev. 
 
Doug replied that at a glance this clone method looks good. 
Without this delayed buffer allocation, a reduced buffer size 
for TermDocs cannot be implemented easily."
0,"Use parallel arrays instead of PostingList objectsThis is Mike's idea that was discussed in LUCENE-2293 and LUCENE-2324.

In order to avoid having very many long-living PostingList objects in TermsHashPerField we want to switch to parallel arrays.  The termsHash will simply be a int[] which maps each term to dense termIDs.

All data that the PostingList classes currently hold will then we placed in parallel arrays, where the termID is the index into the arrays.  This will avoid the need for object pooling, will remove the overhead of object initialization and garbage collection.  Especially garbage collection should benefit significantly when the JVM runs out of memory, because in such a situation the gc mark times can get very long if there is a big number of long-living objects in memory.

Another benefit could be to build more efficient TermVectors.  We could avoid the need of having to store the term string per document in the TermVector.  Instead we could just store the segment-wide termIDs.  This would reduce the size and also make it easier to implement efficient algorithms that use TermVectors, because no term mapping across documents in a segment would be necessary.  Though this improvement we can make with a separate jira issue."

When dealing with a NTLM proxy server that sends response back with lines:

14:51:27:750 << HTTP/1.0 407 Proxy Authentication Required

TlRMTVNTUAACAAAABgAGACgAAAAGggEAtOoNy4M0g0EAAAAAAAAAAEdMT0JBTA==[\r][\n]

The httpClient code is using the ""HTTP/1.0"" as clue for closing the connection 
and ignored the ""Connection: keep-alive"".  That caused the NTLM authentication 
to fail as the NTLM requires the response to the challenge to be sent back on 
the same connection.

Proposed Fix:

Our fix is to add a flag inProxyAuthenticationRetry (in HttpMethodBase) to 
indicate that the method is doing proxy authentication retry.  When the flag is 
true, in ""HttpMethodBase.shouldCloseConnection"", check the ""Connection: keep-
alive"" before determining to close the connection."

Problem seems to be casting issues in RAMInputStream.

both rhs are ints while lhs is long.
so a very large product would first overflow MAX_INT, become negative, and only then (auto) casted to long, but this is too late.

both rhs are longs while lhs is int.
so the (int) cast result may turn negative and the logic that follows would be wrong.

0,"Next steps towards flexible indexingIn working on LUCENE-1410 (PFOR compression) I tried to prototype
switching the postings files to use PFOR instead of vInts for
encoding.

But it quickly became difficult.  EG we currently mux the skip data
into the .frq file, which messes up the int blocks.  We inline
payloads with positions which would also mess up the int blocks.
Skipping offsets and TermInfo offsets hardwire the file pointers of
frq & prox files yet I need to change these to block + offset, etc.

Separately this thread also started up, on how to customize how Lucene
stores positional information in the index:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/66264

So I decided to make a bit more progress towards ""flexible indexing""
by first modularizing/isolating the classes that actually write the
index format.  The idea is to capture the logic of each (terms, freq,
positions/payloads) into separate interfaces and switch the flushing
of a new segment as well as writing the segment during merging to use
the same APIs.

0,"Inefficient growth of OpenBitSetHi, I found a potentially serious efficiency problem with OpenBitSet.

One typical (I think) way to build a bit set is to set() the bits one by one -
e.g., have a HitCollector set() the bit for each matching document.
The underlying array of longs needs to grow as more as more bits are set, of
course.

But looking at the code, it appears to me that the array grows very
ineefficiently - in the worst case (when doc ids are sorted, as they would
normally be in the HitCollector case for example), copying the array again
and again for every added bit... The relevant code in OpenBitSet.java is:

  public void set(long index) {
    int wordNum = expandingWordNum(index);
    ...
  }

  protected int expandingWordNum(long index) {
    int wordNum = (int)(index >> 6);
    if (wordNum>=wlen) {
      ensureCapacity(index+1);
    ...
  }
  public void ensureCapacityWords(int numWords) {
    if (bits.length < numWords) {
      long[] newBits = new long[numWords];
      System.arraycopy(bits,0,newBits,0,wlen);
      bits = newBits;
    }
  }

As you can see, if the bits array is not long enough, a new one is
allocated at exactly the right size - and in the worst case it can grow
just one word every time...

Shouldn't the growth be more exponential in nature, e.g., grow to the maximum
of index+1 and twice the existing size?

Alternatively, if the growth is so inefficient, this should be documented,
and it should be recommended to use the variant of the constructor with the
correct initial size (e.g., in the HitCollector case, the number of documents
in the index). and the fastSet() method instead of set().

Thanks,
Nadav.

than it should have been.  Better to ""pay as you go"" instead.

So we could make a small change to the policy by only merging the
first mergeFactor segments once we hit 2X the merge factor.  With
mergeFactor=10, when we have created the 20th level 0 (just flushed)
segment, we merge the first 10 into a level 1 segment.  Then on
creating another 10 level 0 segments, we merge the second set of 10
level 0 segments into a level 1 segment, etc.

With this new merge policy, an index that's a bit bigger than a
current ""optimization point"" would then have a lower amortized cost
per document.  Plus the merge cost is less ""bunched up"" and less ""pay
it forward"": instead you pay for what you are actually using.

We can start by creating this merge policy (probably, combined with
with the ""by size not by doc count"" segment level computation from
LUCENE-845) and then later decide whether we should make it the
default merge policy.

single text file (_X.pst), looking like this:

{noformat}
field contents
  term file
    doc 0
      pos 5
  term is

      pos 2
  term this
    doc 0
      pos 0

The codec is fully funtional -- all Lucene & Solr tests pass with
-Dtests.codec=SimpleText -- but, its performance is obviously poor.

However, it should be useful for debugging, transparency,
understanding just what Lucene stores in its index, etc.  And it's a
quick way to gain some understanding on how a codec works...

0,"Separate SegmentReaders (and other atomic readers) from composite IndexReadersWith current trunk, whenever you open an IndexReader on a directory you get back a DirectoryReader which is a composite reader. The interface of IndexReader has now lots of methods that simply throw UOE (in fact more than 50% of all methods that are commonly used ones are unuseable now). This confuses users and makes the API hard to understand.

This issue should split ""atomic readers"" from ""reader collections"" with a separate API. After that, you are no longer able, to get TermsEnum without wrapping from those composite readers. We currently have helper classes for wrapping (SlowMultiReaderWrapper - please rename, the name is really ugly; or Multi*), those should be retrofitted to implement the correct classes (SlowMultiReaderWrapper would be an atomic reader but takes a composite reader as ctor param, maybe it could also simply take a List<AtomicReader>). In my opinion, maybe composite readers could implement some collection APIs and also have the ReaderUtil method directly built in (possibly as a ""view"" in the util.Collection sense). In general composite readers do not really need to look like the previous IndexReaders, they could simply be a ""collection"" of SegmentReaders with some functionality like reopen.

On the other side, atomic readers do not need reopen logic anymore? When a segment changes, you need a new atomic reader? - maybe because of deletions thats not the best idea, but we should investigate. Maybe make the whole reopen logic simplier to use (ast least on the collection reader level).

We should decide about good names, i have no preference at the moment."

0,"[PATCH] Avoid checking for TermBuffer in SegmentTermEnum#scanToIt seems that SegmentTermEnum#scanTo is a critical method which is called very often, especially whenever we iterate over a sequence of terms in an index.

When that method is called, the first thing happens is that it checks whether a temporary TermBuffer ""scratch"" has already been initialized.

In fact, this is not necessary. We can simply declare and initialize the ""scratch""-Buffer at the class-level (right now, the initial value is _null_). Java's lazy-loading capabilities allow this without adding any memory footprint for cases where we do not need that buffer.

The attached patch takes care of this. We now save one comparison per term.

1,"Jackrabbit fails to shutdown properly when tomcat is shutting downThis is the same issue already discudded in http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-57

The problem only occurs when Jackrabbit is deployed in the WEB-INF/lib directory of a web application in Tomcat.
During dispose() jackrabbit tries to instantiate a few objects from classes which were not previously loaded by the webapp classloader, but tomcat doesn't allow to load new classes while shutting down.
This causes the repository not to be closed properly, and an annoying set of stack traces are written to the log.

It seems that there are only two classes which are loaded in this situation: org.apache.jackrabbit.core.observation.EventListenerIteratorImpl and org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.FileSystemPathUtil. This is the log from the server standard output:

org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader loadClass
INFO: Illegal access: this web application instance has been stopped already.  Could not load org.apache.jackrabbit.core.observation.EventListenerIteratorImpl.  The eventual following stack trace is caused by an error thrown for debugging purposes as well as to attempt to terminate the thread which caused the illegal access, and has no functional impact.
[repeaded more times at each shutdown]

The eventual following stack trace is caused by an error thrown for debugging purposes as well as to attempt to terminate the thread which caused the illegal access, and has no functional impact.


A quick fix is to force preloading of classes normally needed only during shutdown, simply adding a static block to caller classes. The following patch makes tomcat happy, causing classes to be loaded by the webapp classloaded when still allowed  (probably not really elegant, but perfectly working...)

... this is because in DefaultClientConnectionOperator, prepareSocket (which sets any configured timeouts) isn't called until after SocketFactory.connectSocket. When using SSLSocketFactory, the default behavior is to verify the hostname, which opens a connection, and can block indefinitely.

Simple workaround is to use the AllowAllHostnameVerifier which doesn't do any verification."
0,OCM test are too verboseThe OCM test cases print quite a bit of stuff on standard output which makes the standard build output harder to read. It would be better if the tests either used explicit assertions to verify correct behaviour or at least redirected free-form output to a log file in the target directory.

1,"Read permission on parent node required to access an item's definitionIf a session is granted all permissions on a given item B but lacks permission to read it's parent node A an attempt to
access the definition of B by means of Node.getDefinition or Property.getDefinition will fail with AccessDeniedException.

Similarly, the same session will not be able to modify that item B - e.g. add a child node in case it was a node - since implementation e.g. checks of that
item B isn't protected, which is determined by looking at the definition.

My feeling is, that the item definition should be accessible even if the parent node cannot be read."

Instead, the following things happen:
- There is no node jcr:xmltext
- If the node a has child nodes, they also lose the jcr:xmltext node
- Any nodes on the same level after node a also lose the jcr:xmltext node
- Nodes that come after a, but are on a higher level, have correct jcr:xmltext

1,"UUID compareTo and hashCodeThe current UUID.compareTo implementation is not correct. Usually, 'equals' is used so this is not a big problem, but I need to create an ordered list of UUIDs and for this I need compareTo. The current implementation is based on subtraction, but this doesn't always work. Example:

//long a = 10, b = 20, c = 0;
long a = Long.MAX_VALUE, b = Long.MIN_VALUE, c = 0;
System.out.println((a - b) < 0 ? ""a < b"" : ""a >= b"");
System.out.println((c - a) < 0 ? ""c < a"" : ""c >= a"");
System.out.println((b - c) < 0 ? ""b < c"" : ""b >= c"");

The hashCode implementation is OK, but the multiplication is not required."

1,"jcr2spi spi2dav getProperties returns only cached propertiesI'm using JCR through webdav (contrib jcr2spi and spi2dav libraries).
Server is default jcr server (jackrabbit-webapp-1.3.1 on tomcat),
client is 2007/09/28 svn snapshot

I've noticed that Node.getProperty returns only cached properties. 

Sample test case can be found at http://kplab.tuke.sk/svn/kplab/ctm/trunk/test/org/kplab/tsf/CTMTest.java

Note that sometimes properties do get printed, so it may not be so straightforwarding to reproduce this bug.


Simple Example:

// I have nt:file node at kplab/jojo in my repository
...
Session session = repository.login();
Node root  = session.getRootNode();
Node node = root.getNode(""kplab/jojo"");
// node.getProperty(""jcr:content/jcr:data""); // force to load property
from server
dump(node); // simple dump method from (
http://jackrabbit.apache.org/doc/firststeps.html )


dump prints:
/kplab/jojo
/kplab/jojo/jcr:content

But when I uncomment the getProperty line above, it prints:
/kplab/jojo
/kplab/jojo/jcr:content
/kplab/jojo/jcr:content/jcr:lastModified = 2007-09-27T15:52:27.312+02:00

1,"ItemStateMap warnings during node type changesAs reported already in JCR-1105, the ItemStateMap logs warnings when a cached item state is being overwritten. This shouldn't normally happen, but it turns out that virtual item state providers do this when the root of the virtual tree is modified. Probably the most common such situation is when node types are being modified. This case is luckily not troublesome for the virtual tree functionality, but the logged warnings are annoying.

Here's a relevant part of a stack trace where this problem occurs:

0,"Move listeners from item state to item state managersClients interested in item state modifications directly subscribe to the item states, which is a very flexible approach. On the other side, it increases the memory consumption of an item state, because every item state holds a collection of its listeners. It further increases complexity, because item state listeners can potentially have a shorter life and might be garbage collected.

Listeners should therefore be moved to their associated item state manager. At the same time, this enables an item state manager to completely remove an item state from its cache and resurrect it at a later time without losing the listeners interested in notifications."

0,"Add deleteAllDocuments() method to IndexWriterIdeally, there would be a deleteAllDocuments() or clear() method on the IndexWriter

This method should have the same performance and characteristics as:
* currentWriter.close()
* currentWriter = new IndexWriter(..., create=true,...)

This would greatly optimize a delete all documents case. Using deleteDocuments(new MatchAllDocsQuery()) could be expensive given a large existing index.

IndexWriter.deleteAllDocuments() should have the same semantics as a commit(), as far as index visibility goes (new IndexReader opening would get the empty index)

I see this was previously asked for in LUCENE-932, however it would be nice to finally see this added such that the IndexWriter would not need to be closed to perform the ""clear"" as this seems to be the general recommendation for working with an IndexWriter now

deleteAllDocuments() method should:
* abort any background merges (they are pointless once a deleteAll has been received)
* write new segments file referencing no segments

This method would remove one of the final reasons i would ever need to close an IndexWriter and reopen a new one

0,"SQL2 joins on empty sets are not efficientIt seems that in the cases where the LEFT side of the join doesn't contain any hits, the QueryEngine in unable to generate an efficient query for the RIGHT side, so it basically select all the possible nodes.
See this discussion as context [0].

Example:
LEFT side has hits, RIGHT side select is fast given some conditions: 
> SQL2 JOIN LEFT SIDE took 18 ms. fetched 145 rows.
> SQL2 JOIN RIGHT SIDE took 67 ms. fetched 0 rows.

LEFT side has no hits, RIGHT select everything
> SQL2 JOIN LEFT SIDE took 8 ms. fetched 0 rows.
> SQL2 JOIN RIGHT SIDE took 845 ms. fetched 13055 rows.
...so it fetches 130k nodes and doesn't keep any of them.

this would be similar to LAZY_LOAD except that it would NEVER cache the stored value

This will be useful for very large fields that should always go direct to disk (because they will take so much memory)
when caching Documents returned from a Searcher, the large field may be initially requested as LAZY_LOAD, however once someone reads this field, it will then get locked into memory. if this Document (and others like it) are cached, it can start to use a very large amount of memory for these fields

My guess would be that the problem is on line 929 of Cookie.java:

int domainParts = new StringTokenizer(cookie.getDomain(), ""."").countTokens();

Where domainParts would be 2 for a domain like "".amazon.ca"" instead of the 3
that the code is expecting.  I'm not that familiar with the cookie spec so I
could be completely wrong ;-)

because during preemptive authentication, it is called with a null realm:

 private static Credentials matchCredentials(HashMap map, String realm, String

        HttpAuthRealm entry = new HttpAuthRealm(host, realm);
	// no possible match here, map only contains the version with the realm

This is quite logical since the realm comes from the server and you don't 
contact the server first during preemptive authentication.

But, it should not be possible to set a realm when using preemptive mode, or at 
least it should not be silently ignored.

The current workaround is to set the realm to null in setCredential(), no 
elegant but works.

0,"Move Kuromoji to analysis.ja and introduce Japanese* namingLucene/Solr 3.6 and 4.0 will get out-of-the-box Japanese language support through {{KuromojiAnalyzer}}, {{KuromojiTokenizer}} and various other filters.  These filters currently live in {{org.apache.lucene.analysis.kuromoji}}.

I'm proposing that we move Kuromoji to a new Japanese package {{org.apache.lucene.analysis.ja}} in line with how other languages are organized.  As part of this, I also think we should rename {{KuromojiAnalyzer}} to {{JapaneseAnalyzer}}, etc. to further align naming to our conventions by making it very clear that these analyzers are for Japanese.  (As much as I like the name ""Kuromoji"", I think ""Japanese"" is more fitting.)

A potential issue I see with this that I'd like to raise and get feedback on, is that end-users in Japan and elsewhere who use lucene-gosen could have issues after an upgrade since lucene-gosen is in fact releasing its analyzers under the {{org.apache.lucene.analysis.ja}} namespace (and we'd have a name clash).

I believe users should have the freedom to choose whichever Japanese analyzer, filter, etc. they'd like to use, and I don't want to propose a name change that just creates unnecessary problems for users, but I think the naming proposed above is most fitting for a Lucene/Solr release.

1,"MatchAllScorer calculateDocFilter() bugIn MatchAllScorer.calculateDocFilter(), When you have just two nodes, with different properties, like ""myprop"" and ""myprop2"", and you have an xpath String xpath = ""//*[@myprop], you get both nodes back (to be precise, you'll get every node that has a property that startswith ""myprop"")


You can reproduce it by changing the SimpleQueryTest.testIsNotNull() a little:

Change 

bar.setProperty(""text"", ""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""); 

to

bar.setProperty(""mytextwhichstartswithmytext"", ""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."");

Now the test with xpath = ""//*[@jcr:primaryType='nt:unstructured' and @mytext]""; fails because 2 results. I did test for the trunk and tag 1.3.1 and both have the same problem. I have attached MatchAllScorer.java.patch in this mail, or should I create a JIRA issue for this? 

Furthermore I would like to discuss a different implementation for the MatchAllScorer, because IMHO the current calculateDocFilter() becomes slow pretty fast (see bottom email the code part i am referring to: if you have 100.000 docs with ""mytext"" property, and you query  [@mytext] the loop below is executed at least 100.000 times). I think it might be out of scope for the user-list, or is the user-list the place to discuss something like this?

0,"WebDAV BIND supportI'm tempted to work on implementing the WebDAV BIND protocol, as currently defined in http://greenbytes.de/tech/webdav/draft-ietf-webdav-bind-20.html.

This issue can be used to collect design proposals and track progress.

1) DAV:resource-id live property

This can be implemented in terms of the JCR UUID. However, we need to turn this one into a URI for WebDAV. If the JCR UUID happens to *really* use UUID syntax, we *could* use urn:uuid. Otherwise, it would probably useful to mint an HTTP URI, served by the WebDAV servlet. (note that the latter has the disadvantage that moving a node to a different server will affect its resource-id, in case that other server allows importing UUIDs).

2) REBIND and UNBIND methods

Same as MOVE and DELETE, with the excpetion of marshalling.

3) DAV:parent-set property

Either trivial (when node isn't shared), or needs to use the JCR 2.0 shared set functionality.

4) BIND method

Either trivial (when shareable nodes aren't supported), or needs to use the JCR 2.0 shared set functionality.

5) Cycle detection in depth:infinity requests

TBD :-)

1,"QueryImpl result offSet must be considered after security class grant the item.ackrabbit version is 1.4 (jackrabbit-core - 1.4.5).
I use searches with result limit and offset but it is working some wrong for my case.

NAME      - GRANTACCESS -   OFFSET
node1     -     true                    - 0
node2     -     false                  -  1

node5     -     false                  -  4

My page must have 2 records, so first I do a count for the search and get size of 3 records (after filtered by my security class invoked automatically by jackrabbit), so I have 2 pages to show to the user. The first page must return 2 records, of course, and the second must return 1 record.

In the first search I do set:
QueryImp.setOffset(0);
QueryImpl.setLimit(2);

So, I get the nodes 1 and 3, thats correct.

In the second same search (for second page), I do set:
QueryImp.setOffset(2);
QueryImpl.setLimit(2);

This way I pretend to get two records, starting from the record nro 3, which would be only the node4.
But, the result I got is node3 (again) and node4, because the offset worked not according to the grantacess (provided by the security class), but according to the sequence of the raw result.

This offset have to start in the correct position, counting only the granted nodes returned by the security class.
Hope this make sense for you.

Thanks.

1,"AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget does not recognize target host correctlyI am trying to execute an HttpGet with the following URI:
""http://www.foo.foo/doSomething.html?url=http://www.bar.bar/doSomethingElse.html""

This leads to UnknownHostException

Going through the internal code, the problem seems to be in the AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget method:
            String ssp = requestURI.getSchemeSpecificPart();
            ssp = ssp.substring(2, ssp.length()); //remove ""//"" prefix
            int end = ssp.indexOf(':') > 0 ? ssp.indexOf(':') :
                    ssp.indexOf('/') > 0 ? ssp.indexOf('/') :
                    ssp.indexOf('?') > 0 ? ssp.indexOf('?') : ssp.length();
            String host = ssp.substring(0, end);

This code sets the target host to ""www.foo.foo/doSomething.html?url=http"" instead of ""www.foo.foo"". This obviously breaks the execution not far down the line... DefaultClientConnectionOperator.resolveHostname throws an UnknownHostException.

FWIW the AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget method actually has access to the request URI object, which correctly states that the host is ""www.foo.foo"".

So why does it try to extract the host from the scheme specific part anyway?

I hope this is useful... and if there is any workaround please let me know, as I'm stuck on this one.

The issue happens if one thread calls commit while another is flushing, and is exacerbated at high flush rates (eg maxBufferedDocs=2).  The thread doing commit will first flush, and then it syncs the files.  However in between those two, if other threads manage to add enough docs and trigger another flush, a 2nd new segment can sneak into the SegmentInfos before we sync.

This is normally harmless, in that it just means the commit includes a few more docs that had been added by other threads, so it's fine. But, it can mean that a committed segment references the still-open doc store files.  Our tests now catch this (I changed MockDirWrapper to throw an exception in this case), and so testCommitThreadSafety can fail with this exception.

No good reason: it's historical. 
 
To avoid this either: (a) the BufferedIndexInput API would need to be

RAMInputStream could subclass IndexInput directly, using its own

1,"NPE Thrown when two Cluster Nodes are hitting the same underlying database.I've created a test that creates two repositories with clustering enabled that are backed by the same database.  Using the following workflow causes a NullPointerException to be thrown.

The workflow I'm using is:
The root node is versioned.
ClusterNode1 creates a versioned child node named ""foo"".
The test waits to make sure the syncDelay has passed so ClusterNode2 will notice the newly created node.
ClusterNode2 retrieves the ""foo"" child node and removes it.
The test waits for the change ClusterNode1 to sync with that change.
ClusterNode1 tries to create another new node however a NullPointerException is thrown when the it tries to checkout the rootNode.

However, it does not account for which fields actually exist in the index when doing so.  For instance, if you index tiers 1 through 10, but then choose a very small radius to restrict the space to, it will likely choose a tier like 15 or 16, which of course does not exist."

1,"IdleConnectionHandler can leave closed connections in a inconsistent stateIdleConnectionHandler when shutting down 'stale' connection does not update the state of AbstractPoolEntry thus causing an inconsistency between the state of the connection (closed) and that of the pool entry (still assumed open). The problem is mitigated by the fact that the pooling manager usually evicts closed connections almost immediately. There is a small window of time in the ThreadSafeClientConnManager#closeIdleConnection method, at which a connection can be closed by the IdleConnectionHandler and immediately leased from the pool by another thread in an inconsistent state before the main thread gets a chance to re-acquire the pool lock and clean out closed connections.

For 4.0.x the problem can be worked around by retaining the pool lock for the entire span of the #closeIdleConnection. For the 4.1 branch a better solution should be devised. This probably means a complete rewrite or deprecation of IdleConnectionHandler."

0,"Manage Lucene FieldCaches per index segmentJackrabbit uses an IndexSearcher which searches on a single IndexReader which is most likely to be an instance of CachingMultiReader. On every search that does sorting or range queries a FieldCache is populated and associated with this instance of a CachingMultiReader. On successive queries which operate on this CachingMultiReader you will get a tremendous speedup for queries which can reuse  those associated FieldCache instances.
The problem is that Jackrabbit creates a new CachingMultiReader _everytime_ one of the underlying indexes are modified. This means if you just change _one_ item in the repository you will need to rebuild all those FieldCaches because the existing FieldCaches are associated with the old instance of CachingMultiReader.
This does not only lead to slow search response times for queries which contains range queries or are sorted by a field but also leads to massive memory consumption (depending on the size of your indexes) because there might be multiple instances of CachingMultiReaders in use if you have a scenario where a lot of queries and item modifications are executed concurrently.
The goal is to keep those FieldCaches as long as possible."
1,"PdfTextFilter may leave parsed document open in case of errorsIn case of errors in a parsed PDF document jackrabbit may fail to properly close the parsed document. PDFBox will write a stack trace to system out at finalize to warn agains this.

this may happens because the parse() method at

parser = new PDFParser(new BufferedInputStream(in));
parser.parse();

immediately creates a document, but it can throw an exception while processing the file.
PdfTextFilter should check if parser still holds a document and close it appropriately.

0,"Sep codec should store less in terms dictI'm working on improving Lucene's performance with int block codecs
(FOR/PFOR), but in early perf testing I found that these codecs cause
a big perf hit to those MTQs that need to scan many terms but don't
end up accepting many of those terms (eg fuzzy, wildcard, regexp).

This is because sep codec stores much more in the terms dict, since
each file is separate, ie seek points for each of doc, frq, pos, pyl,
skp files.

So I'd like to shift these seek points to instead be stored in the doc
file, except for the doc seek point itself.  Since a given query will
always need to seek to the doc file, this does not add an extra seek.
But it saves tons of vInt decodes for the next/seke intensive MTQs...

0,"Re-add SorterTemplate and use it to provide fast ArraySorting and replace BytesRefHash sortingThis patch adds back an optimized and rewritten SorterTemplate back to Lucene (removed after release of 3.0). It is of use for several components:

- Automaton: Automaton needs to sort States and other things. Using Arrays.sort() is slow, because it clones internally to ensure stable search. This component is much faster. This patch adds Arrays.sort() replacements in ArrayUtil that work with natural order or using a Comparator<?>. You can choose between quickSort and mergeSort.
- BytesRefHash uses another QuickSort algorithm without insertionSort for very short ord arrays. This class uses SorterTemplate to provide the same with insertionSort fallback in a very elegant way. Ideally this class can be used everywhere, where the sort algorithm needs to be separated from the underlying data and you can implement a swap() and compare() function (that get slot numbers instead of real values). This also applies to Solr (Yonik?).

SorterTemplate provides quickSort and mergeSort algorithms. Internally for short arrays, it automatically chooses insertionSort (like JDK's Arrays). The quickSort algorith was copied modified from old BytesRefHash. This new class only shares MergeSort with the original CGLIB SorterTemplate, which is no longer maintained."

1,"CookieSpecBase.domainMatch() leaks cookies to 3rd party domainsThe change committed for #32833
<http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32833> is buggy; it doesn't
match browser behavior and in fact leaks cookies to third party domains. 

To see, try the following:

CookieSpecBase cspec = new CookieSpecBase();
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("".hotmail.com"",""foo"",""bar"",""/"",Integer.MAX_VALUE,false);
cspec.match(""iwanttostealcookiesfromhotmail.com"",80,""/"",false,cookie);

It will return true. Testing in Firefox1.0.4 and IE6 show no such similar
leakage for similar cases. (Indeed, it'd be a headline-making privacy bug if
they were to do this.)

Those browsers do, in my limited testing, behave as desired by the filer of
#32833: a cookie of domain value '.mydomain.com' will be returned to exact host
'mydomain.com' (. However, the fix that was suggested was overbroad.

I suggest instead for CookieSpecBase.domainMatch():

    public boolean domainMatch(final String host, final String domain) {
// BUGGY: matches a '.service.com' cookie to hosts like 'enemyofservice.com'
//        return host.endsWith(domain)
//            || (domain.startsWith(""."") && host.endsWith(domain.substring(1)));
// BETTER: RFC2109, plus matches a '.service.com' cookie to exact host 'service.com'
        return host.equals(domain)
            || (domain.startsWith(""."") 
                    && (host.endsWith(domain)
                            || host.equals(domain.substring(1))));

0,"Selective disabling of checks in ItemValidatorI would like to be able to selectively disable checks in ItemValidator in the scope of an operation performed through methods of the SessionState class. Doing so would provide simple means for internally modifying (for example) protected items. Currently such modifications must be done 'manually' on the item state level. This approach is very error prone and not very DRY.

With my upcoming patch in place, setting a protected property would look like this:

final Node parent = ...
final Value value = ...
SessionState sessionState = sessionContext.getSessionState();

Property property = sessionState.performUnchecked(new SessionOperation<Property>() {
    public Property perform(SessionContext context) throws RepositoryException {
        return parent.setProperty(""foo"", value);
    }
}, ItemValidator.CHECK_CONSTRAINTS);

That is, users need to have access to the session context in order to disable checks which makes this only usable from inside Jackrabbit. "
0,"Provide means for exception handling for QueryNodeVisitor implementationsCurrently the methods of QueryNodeVisitor do not declare any exceptions. Even though the query tree might be syntactically correct, an implementation might reach a point where it cannot continue (i.e. if it does not support one of the optional query features). For such cases there are currently two solution: 1. throw an unchecked exception or 2. communicate the error state through the visitor using the data object passed along. 
While I don't like 2. it is still an option. For 1. I'm not sure if this is the right way to go. It might be better to actually throw a checked exception. I therefore created a patch which declares RepositoryException on all visit methods of QueryNodeVisitor. Although the necessary changes in classes using QueryNodeVisitor are trivial, there are quite many of them. 

Any opinions on checked exception with probably breaking (trivially) existing code vs. using not checked exceptions?

The current issues are:
* the current api is hardcoded for booleanquery's Occurs, but we should support other types of children (e.g. disjunctionmax)
* it can be difficult to use the API, because of the amount of generics and the visitor callback API. 
* the current API enforces a DFS traversal when you might prefer BFS instead.

0,"Allow to disable referential integrity checking for workspaceSome operations like clone, remove operating on huge subtree of nodes requires a lot of memory. To copy, clone, remove subtree all nodes are loaded into transient spaces. It allows such operations to be transactional, from other side it requires a lot of heap size and this memory size is directly dependent on the size of subtree (number of nodes). In result of this in some cases it is impossible to make such operations in one step. In our environment sometimes 1 GB of java heap is not enough to succesfully clone subtree  from one workspace to another.

You can always clone (copy, remove) tree in chunks, but if you have references between subtrees such approach fails. Possibilty of temporary disabling referential integrity checking for experienced JCR user could be very usefull then.

Another use case is to allow to clone selected subtrees of the whole structure between worskpaces. In our application we need to clone only some selected subtrees from one workspace to another. But we can not do that because of existing references. We need to clone the whol estructure first, then remove all unwanted nodes, which is really time expensive and memory consuming.

1,"CachingHttpClient returns a 411 respones when executing a POST (HttpPost) request The CachingHttpClient validates requests prior executing them, by calling RequestProtocolCompliance.requestIsFatallyNonCompliant(..).

When executing an HttpPost, this method considers the request is invalid because it does not contain (yet) a content-length header. Indeed, I observed that this header is generated at the time the DefaultHttpClient fires the request.

NB: i'm using the Cache 4.1-alpha2 plugged over the HttpClient 4.0.1-final. I can't use the latest version for both because I need to rely on a stable version if there's any. I would be curious to know if we get the same behaviour in 4.1...

Anyway, I would see two fixes for that issue:
- make HttpPost set the content-length at the time the entity is set,
- or remove the validation step on the CachingHttpClient side.

0,"Create org.apache.jackrabbit.core.idI'd like to create a separate package for the identifier interfaces and classes in jackrabbit-core. Currently all the identifiers are in org.apache.jackrabbit.core, which makes almost all the other packages have dependencies to o.a.j.core and causes trouble for various package-level code quality and dependency analysis tools.

For now the package would contain the ItemId, NodeId, and PropertyId classes."
0,"Move tika-parsers dependency to deployment packagesAs discussed on the mailing list, it would be better if the tika-parsers dependency (and all the parser libraries it pulls in transitively) was included in our deployment packages but not directly in jackrabbit-core. This would make it easier for people to set up custom lightweight deployments with no or only partial full text extraction functionality.

To do this we'll first need to wait for Tika 0.9, as we currently have a custom PDFParser class in jackrabbit-core as a workaround to a problem in Tika 0.8.

At the same time we should do a more thorough review of the transitive parser dependencies we include. At least the rome and bouncycastle libraries were flagged as potentially unnecessary."
0,"TermScorer caches values unnecessarilyTermScorer aggressively caches the doc and freq of 32 documents at a time for each term scored.  When querying for a lot of terms, this causes a lot of garbage to be created that's unnecessary.  The SegmentTermDocs from which it retrieves its information doesn't have any optimizations for bulk loading, and it's unnecessary.

In addition, it has a SCORE_CACHE, that's of limited benefit.  It's caching the result of a sqrt that should be placed in DefaultSimilarity, and if you're only scoring a few documents that contain those terms, there's no need to precalculate the SQRT, especially on modern VMs.

Enclosed is a patch that replaces TermScorer with a version that does not cache the docs or feqs.  In the case of a lot of queries, that saves 196 bytes/term, the unnecessary disk IO, and extra SQRTs which adds up."
1,"Suggested Patches to MultiPhraseQuery and QueryTermExtractor (for use with HighLighter)I encountered a problem with the Highlighter, where it was not recognizing MultiPhraseQuery.
To fix this, I developed the following two patches:

=====================================================
1. Addition to org.apache.lucene.search.MultiPhraseQuery:

Add the following method:

/** Returns the set of terms in this phrase. */
public Term[] getTerms() {
  ArrayList allTerms = new ArrayList();
  Iterator iterator = termArrays.iterator();
  while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    Term[] terms = (Term[])iterator.next();
    for (int i = 0, n = terms.length; i < n; ++i) {
      allTerms.add(terms[i]);
    }
  }
  return (Term[])allTerms.toArray(new Term[0]);
}

=====================================================
2. Patch to org.apache.lucene.search.highlight.QueryTermExtractor:

a) Add the following import:
import org.apache.lucene.search.MultiPhraseQuery;

b) Add the following code to the end of the getTerms(...) method:
      else  if(query instanceof MultiPhraseQuery)
              getTermsFromMultiPhraseQuery((MultiPhraseQuery) query, terms, fieldName);
  }

c) Add the following method:
 private static final void getTermsFromMultiPhraseQuery(MultiPhraseQuery query, HashSet terms, String fieldName)
 {
   Term[] queryTerms = query.getTerms();
   int i;

   for (i = 0; i < queryTerms.length; i++)
   {
       if((fieldName==null)||(queryTerms[i].field()==fieldName))
       {
           terms.add(new WeightedTerm(query.getBoost(),queryTerms[i].text()));
       }
   }
 }

0,Remaining contrib testcases should use Version based ctors instead of deprecated onesMany testcases in contrib use deprecated ctors for WhitespaceTokenizer / Analyzer etc.
1,"Group#getMembers may list inherited members multiple timesi just happen to detect the following regression that seems to be introduces quite a while ago:

Group#getMembers is defined to return all group members including those inherited by another group being member of that group.

Example:
User t
Group a : t is declared member
Group b : t is declared member
Group c : a, b are declared members

The expected result of Group.getMembers was: a, b and t.

What is currently happening is that t is included twice in the returned iterator.
Quickly testing on jackrabbit 2.0 revealed that this used to work before...

I didn't carefully check when that bug has been introduced but the the refactoring of the membership
collections seems to be a possible culprit.

We have seen other configurations where a node suddenly behaves as the another node that has references and throw a reference exception, and yet other configurations where the node we though we deleted still exists, and another node has now disappeared.

0,"Behavior on hard power shutdownWhen indexing a large number of documents, upon a hard power failure  (e.g. pull the power cord), the index seems to get corrupted. We start a Java application as an Windows Service, and feed it documents. In some cases (after an index size of 1.7GB, with 30-40 index segment .cfs files) , the following is observed.

The 'segments' file contains only zeros. Its size is 265 bytes - all bytes are zeros.
The 'deleted' file also contains only zeros. Its size is 85 bytes - all bytes are zeros.

Before corruption, the segments file and deleted file appear to be correct. After this corruption, the index is corrupted and lost.

This is a problem observed in Lucene 1.4.3. We are not able to upgrade our customer deployments to 1.9 or later version, but would be happy to back-port a patch, if the patch is small enough and if this problem is already solved.

1,"jcr2spi NodeEntryImpl.getPath() blows stack due to getIndex() calling itselfThe jcr2spi NodeEntryImpl class contains logic that causes getIndex() to call itself.

Calling code:

    Session sess = repo.login(creds);
    Node inboxNode = sess.getRootNode().getNode(""Inbox"");
    inboxNode.getPath(); <== blows stack

Tracing reveals:

    1. NodeEntryImpl.getPath() ultimately calls getIndex()
    2. getIndex() calls NodeState.getDefinition()
    3. which calls ItemDefinitionProviderImpl.getQNodeDefinition(...)
    4. which catches a RepositoryException then calls NodeEntryImpl.getWorkspaceId()
    5. which calls NodeEntryImpl.getWorkspaceIndex()
    6. which calls getIndex() (back to step 2, ad infinitum)

Configuration:
    1. A configuration is loaded specifying in-memory persist manager
    2. Config is wrapped in TransientRepository
    3. that's wrapped in spi2jcr's RepositoryService using default BatchReadConfig
    4. a jcr2spi provider is instantiated that directly couples to spi2jcr
    5. Node in question is created as follows:

0,"Exclude system index for queries that restrict the result set to nodetypes not availble in the ""jcr:system"" subtreeWe already have code that is able to decide whether the system index needs to be included in a search or not (see JCR-967). If I execute a query like ""my:app//element(*, my:doc)"" this will only search the workspace index. Unfortunately this is slower than ""//element(*, my:doc)"", since the first query can not be optimized as the second. In our case both queries return the same result set because we use application specific node types. Even though the second query includes the system index it is still faster than the first one. But it could be even faster because it doesn't need to search the system index because nodes with the application specific node type can't be added to the ""jcr:system""-tree and are therefore are added never to the system index (am I right?)."

1,"CMS fails to cleanly stop threadsWhen you close IW, it waits for (or aborts and then waits for) all running merges.

However, it's wait criteria is wrong -- it waits for the threads to be done w/ their merges, not for the threads to actually die.

CMS already has a sync() method, to wait for running threads, which we can call from CMS.close.  However it has a thread hazard because a MergeThread removes itself from mergeThreads before it actually exits.  So sync() is able to return even while a merge thread is still running.

here is a relevant snipped from the mailing list discussion

{noformat}
getEnum() is protected so it is intended to be called *only* by subclasses (that's the idea behind protected methods). They are also accessible by other classes from the same package, but that's more a Java bug than a feature. The problem with MTQ is that RewriteMethod is a separate *class* and *not a subclass* of MTQ, so the method cannot be called (it can because of the ""java bug"" called from same package). So theoretically it has to be public otherwise you cannot call getEnum().

Another cleaner fix would be to add a protected final method to RewriteMethod that calls this method from MTQ. So anything subclassing RewriteMethod can get the enum from inside the RewriteMethod class which is the ""correct"" way to handle it. Delegating to MTQ is then ""internal"".

The Jackrabbit webapp would deploy without problems, but when I undeploy the webapp Tomcat fails to remove the Derby jar in WEB-INF/lib (I have unpackWARs enabled). This causes problems especially when I have autoDeploy enabled, as Tomcat then deploys the skeleton webapp right after undeployment, and the only way to really get rid of the webapp is to shutdown Tomcat and to manually remove the webapp on the file system.

I suspect that this problem is related to Derby jar being somehow referenced even after the webapp is undeployed, causing Windows to prevent the jar file from being removed.

0,"JavaCC grammar generation to ${maven.build.dir}/generated-srcCurrently the JavaCC grammars in src/grammar/{xpath,sql} are processed into Java source files in src/java/org/apache/jacrabbit/core/query/{xpath,sql} where we also have normal version controlled source files. This leads to the need to maintain special svn:ignore properties and also the more general issue of mixing manually written and automatically generated source files.

I'm proposing (as a wish, you are free to disagree) that the JavaCC grammars be generated into Java files within the Maven build directory. The attached patch modifies the javacc maven goals to generate files into ${maven.build.dir}/generated-src. The modified prepare-filesystem goal also adds the generated source path ${maven.build.dir}/generated-src/main/java into the maven compile set so that the generated sources are included in the normal builds.

On the other hand, AbstractJournal.sync() locks AbstractJournal.rwLock, then calls NodeTypeRecord.process, which calls NodeTypeRegistry.unregisterNodeTypes, which is also synchronized.

Possible solutions: Either 

- NodeTypeRegistry doesn't synchronize on the object when calling a eventChannel method,

- or NodeTypeRegistry locks AbstractJournal.rwLock before synchronizing.

There might be other solutions."

0,"Some improvements to CMSWhile running optimize on a large index, I've noticed several things that got me to read CMS code more carefully, and find these issues:

* CMS may hold onto a merge if maxMergeCount is hit. That results in the MergeThreads taking merges from the IndexWriter until they are exhausted, and only then that blocked merge will run. I think it's unnecessary that that merge will be blocked.

* CMS sorts merges by segments size, doc-based and not bytes-based. Since the default MP is LogByteSizeMP, and I hardly believe people care about doc-based size segments anymore, I think we should switch the default impl. There are two ways to make it extensible, if we want:
** Have an overridable member/method in CMS that you can extend and override - easy.
** Have OneMerge be comparable and let the MP determine the order (e.g. by bytes, docs, calibrate deletes etc.). Better, but will need to tap into several places in the code, so more risky and complicated.

On the go, I'd like to add some documentation to CMS - it's not very easy to read and follow.

I'll work on a patch."
0,"First cut at column-stride fields (index values storage)I created an initial basic impl for storing ""index values"" (ie
column-stride value storage).  This is still a work in progress... but
the approach looks compelling.  I'm posting my current status/patch
here to get feedback/iterate, etc.

The code is standalone now, and lives under new package
oal.index.values (plus some util changes, refactorings) -- I have yet
to integrate into Lucene so eg you can mark that a given Field's value
should be stored into the index values, sorting will use these values
instead of field cache, etc.

It handles 3 types of values:

  * Six variants of byte[] per doc, all combinations of fixed vs
    variable length, and stored either ""straight"" (good for eg a
    ""title"" field), ""deref"" (good when many docs share the same value,
    but you won't do any sorting) or ""sorted"".

  * Integers (variable bit precision used as necessary, ie this can
    store byte/short/int/long, and all precisions in between)

  * Floats (4 or 8 byte precision)

String fields are stored as the UTF8 byte[].  This patch adds a
BytesRef, which does the same thing as flex's TermRef (we should merge
them).

This patch also adds basic initial impl of PackedInts (LUCENE-1990);
we can swap that out if/when we get a better impl.

This storage is dense (like field cache), so it's appropriate when the
field occurs in all/most docs.  It's just like field cache, except the
reading API is a get() method invocation, per document.

Next step is to do basic integration with Lucene, and then compare
sort performance of this vs field cache.

For the ""sort by String value"" case, I think RAM usage & GC load of
this index values API should be much better than field caache, since
it does not create object per document (instead shares big long[] and
byte[] across all docs), and because the values are stored in RAM as
their UTF8 bytes.

There are abstract Writer/Reader classes.  The current reader impls
are entirely RAM resident (like field cache), but the API is (I think)
agnostic, ie, one could make an MMAP impl instead.

I think this is the first baby step towards LUCENE-1231.  Ie, it
cannot yet update values, and the reading API is fully random-access
by docID (like field cache), not like a posting list, though I
do think we should add an iterator() api (to return flex's DocsEnum)
-- eg I think this would be a good way to track avg doc/field length
for BM25/lnu.ltc scoring.

1,"problems with IR's readerFinishedListenerThere are two major problems:
1. The listener api does not really apply all indexreaders. for example segmentreaders dont fire it on close, only segmentcorereaders. this is wrong, a segmentcorereader is *not* an indexreader. Furthermore, if you register it on a top-level reader you get events for anything under the reader tree (sometimes, unless they are segmentreaders as mentioned above, where it doesnt work correctly at all).
2. Furthermore your listener is 'passed along' in a viral fashion from clone() and reopen(). This means for example, if you are trying to listen to readers in NRT search you are just accumulating reader listeners, all potentially keeping references to old indexreaders (because, in order to deal with #1 your listener must 'keep' a reference to the IR it was registered on, so it can check if thats *really* the one).

We should discuss how to fix #1. 

I will create a patch for #2 shortly and commit it, its just plain wrong.

1,"httpClient failed to reconnect after keep-alive connection timed outDescription:

When using httpClient with https tunnelling througha proxy server, after keep-
alive connection timed out on server side.  The httpClient code was unable to 
establish the connection again.

Cause:

The HttpMethodBase.processRequest's retry loop retries the connection without 
going through the ""CONNECT"" request to the proxy server.  Our proxy server 
returns 407 error code.  In case of tunnelling connection, proper reconnect 
should be done by first doing the ""CONNECT"" sequence to get authenticated 
throught the proxy.

Temp fix and Work around:

We implemented some work around to do the retry from the application layer.  In 
order to detect the situation, we have to rely on the error message contained 
in the HttpRecoverableException.  We are checking the text ""Connection aborted 
by peer: socket write error"".  We also have to modify the HttpMethodBase code 
to throw the HttpRecoverableException out to the application."

we have got a NullPointerException in the Lucene-class CompoundFileReader:

java.lang.NullPointerException

        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.close(IndexWriter.java:236)

Lucene has been working fine for some days, until this NullPointerException
has occured which has corrupted the complete index.

The reason for this NullPointerException is the following Code 
in Lucenes source file CompoundFileReader.java:

    public CompoundFileReader(Directory dir, String name)
    throws IOException
    {
        boolean success = false;
        ...

        try {
            stream = dir.openFile(name);

            // read the directory and init files
            ...

            success = true;

        } finally {
            if (! success) {
                try {
                    stream.close();
                } catch (IOException e) { }
            }
        }
    }

If the IO-method-call ""dir.openFile()"" throws an IOExeption,
then the variable ""stream"" remains its null value.
The statement ""stream.close()"" in the finally clause will then cause a
NullPointerException.

I would suggest that you change the code from:
    stream.close();
to:
    if ( stream != null ) {
        stream.close();
    }

There are a lot of reasons why an IO-operation like ""dir.openFile()""
could throw an IOException.
I cannot guarantee that such an IO exception will never occur again.
Therefore it is better to handle such an IO exception correctly.

This issue is similar to bug# 29774, except that I recommand an easy way
to solve this problem."

Thus I propose to simplify the existing tests so that they just compare timestamps (factoring out the time zone), and do not require resolution finer than 1s. These two aspects then should be tested in a separate test case (thinking of it, they currently may not test sub-second resolution, in which case I propose to leave things as they are with respect to this).

0,"Integrate IndexReader with IndexWriter The current problem is an IndexReader and IndexWriter cannot be open
at the same time and perform updates as they both require a write
lock to the index. While methods such as IW.deleteDocuments enables
deleting from IW, methods such as IR.deleteDocument(int doc) and
norms updating are not available from IW. This limits the
capabilities of performing updates to the index dynamically or in
realtime without closing the IW and opening an IR, deleting or
updating norms, flushing, then opening the IW again, a process which
can be detrimental to realtime updates. 

This patch will expose an IndexWriter.getReader method that returns
the currently flushed state of the index as a class that implements
IndexReader. The new IR implementation will differ from existing IR
implementations such as MultiSegmentReader in that flushing will
synchronize updates with IW in part by sharing the write lock. All
methods of IR will be usable including reopen and clone.

Having these in the Maven repo allows an IDE (like Eclipse) to auto-download and attach the source/javadoc to the HttpComponent jar files - meaning developers will then see the API documentation automatically in their IDE.  This also greatly aids debugging if one needs to step through HttpComponent code, and placing the source in the hands of more developers also means you might see more patches coming back."
1,"If you ""flush by RAM usage"" then IndexWriter may over-mergeI think a good way to maximize performance of Lucene's indexing for a
given amount of RAM is to flush (writer.flush()) the added documents
whenever the RAM usage (writer.ramSizeInBytes()) has crossed the max
RAM you can afford.

But, this can confuse the merge policy and cause over-merging, unless
you set maxBufferedDocs properly.

This is because the merge policy looks at the current maxBufferedDocs
to figure out which segments are level 0 (first flushed) or level 1
(merged from <mergeFactor> level 0 segments).

I'm not sure how to fix this.  Maybe we can look at net size (bytes)
of a segment and ""infer"" level from this?  Still we would have to be
resilient to the application suddenly increasing the RAM allowed.

The good news is to workaround this bug I think you just need to
ensure that your maxBufferedDocs is less than mergeFactor *
typical-number-of-docs-flushed.

1,"finalize()-methods of FSDirectory.FSIndexInput and FSDirectory.FSIndexOutput try to close already closed fileHi all,

I found a small problem in FSDirectory: The finalize()-methods of FSDirectory.FSIndexInput and FSDirectory.FSIndexOutput try to close the underlying file. This is not a problem unless the file has been closed before by calling the close() method. If it has been closed before, the finalize method throws an IOException saying that the file is already closed. Usually this IOException would go unnoticed, because the GarbageCollector, which calls finalize(), just eats it. However, if I use the Eclipse debugger the execution of my code will always be suspended when this exception is thrown.

Even though this exception probably won't cause problems during normal execution of Lucene, the code becomes cleaner if we apply this small patch. Might this IOException also have a performance impact, if it is thrown very frequently?

I attached the patch which applies cleanly on the current svn HEAD. All testcases pass and I verfied with the Eclipse debugger that the IOException is not longer thrown."

0,"Automaton Query/Filter (scalable regex)Attached is a patch for an AutomatonQuery/Filter (name can change if its not suitable).

Whereas the out-of-box contrib RegexQuery is nice, I have some very large indexes (100M+ unique tokens) where queries are quite slow, 2 minutes, etc. Additionally all of the existing RegexQuery implementations in Lucene are really slow if there is no constant prefix. This implementation does not depend upon constant prefix, and runs the same query in 640ms.

Some use cases I envision:
 1. lexicography/etc on large text corpora
 2. looking for things such as urls where the prefix is not constant (http:// or ftp://)

The Filter uses the BRICS package (http://www.brics.dk/automaton/) to convert regular expressions into a DFA. Then, the filter ""enumerates"" terms in a special way, by using the underlying state machine. Here is my short description from the comments:

     The algorithm here is pretty basic. Enumerate terms but instead of a binary accept/reject do:
      
     1. Look at the portion that is OK (did not enter a reject state in the DFA)
     2. Generate the next possible String and seek to that.

the Query simply wraps the filter with ConstantScoreQuery.

> - session A logs out and starts to iterate over I in  LocalItemStateManager (LISM)
> - session B saves changes and removed items are evicted from A's LISM
> - session A gets concurrent modification exception

Another scenario is the following:
- Session A gets the iterator of the values of (the primary cache of) an ItemStateReferenceCache in LocalItemStateManager.dispose.
- Session B then does something that triggers the CacheManager.
- The CacheManager then calls resizeAll, and evicts some items from the secondary cache of the ItemStateReferenceCache of which the LocalItemStateManager has a values iterator.
- The garbage collector then runs and evicts the removed items also from the primary cache, which effectively modifies the set over which is iterated.

(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damerau%E2%80%93Levenshtein_distance)

According to the benchmarks in the original paper, the performance for LevT looks to be very similar to Lev.

Support for this is now in moman (https://bitbucket.org/jpbarrette/moman/) thanks to Jean-Philippe 
Barrette-LaPierre.

1,"MultipartPostMethod Holding File Stream Open?From: ""Daniel Walsh"" <daniel.walsh13@verizon.net>
Date: Tue Feb 25, 2003  8:05:49 PM US/Eastern
To: ""Commons HttpClient Project"" <commons-httpclient-dev@jakarta.apache.org>
Subject: MultipartPostMethod Holding File Stream Open?
Reply-To: ""Commons HttpClient Project"" <commons-httpclient-dev@jakarta.apache.org>

I'm using a MultipartPostMethod to upload a file to a servlet:

File file = new File(strUrl);

HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
HostConfiguration hostConfig = new HostConfiguration();
MultipartPostMethod mpPost = new MultipartPostMethod();

 hostConfig.setHost(someURL.getHost(), someURL.getPort(), someURL.getProtocol());
client.setConnectionTimeout(30000);
client.setHostConfiguration(hostConfig);

mpPost.addParameter(""someName"", ""someValue"");
mpPost.addParameter(file.getName(), file);

mpPost.setPath(strPath);
client.executeMethod(mpPost);

String confirmUpload = tpPost.getResponseBodyAsString();
mpPost.releaseConnection();

file.delete();  // this is being blocked.

After the upload, I would like to delete the file off of my disk.  Using other
methods of uploading the file (in particular a PutMethod), I was able to then
delete the file after the upload.  Now that I am using the MultipartPostMethod
obj for the upload, I am unable to delete the file (the return value is false,
and there is no SecurityException being thrown - no SecurityManager even set as
of this point either).

So, I guess my question is whether there is a call to the MultipartPostMethod
obj that I'm overlooking that would release it's connection (I'm sure that it is
opening an InputStream of some sort to read the file contents, in order to form
the HTTP message) to the file - so that I can then have unimpeded access to it
for other operations?"

0,"concurrent read-only access to a sessionEven though the JCR specification does not make a statement about Sessions shared across a number of threads I think it would be great for many applications if we could state that sharing a read-only session is supported by Jackrabbit.
On many occasions in the mailing lists we stated that there should not be an issue with sharing a read-only session, however I think it has never been thoroughly tested or even specified as a ""design goal"".

If we can come to an agreement that this is desirable I think it would be great to start including testcases to validate that behaviour and update the documentation respectively."
0,"Add the ability to disable inheriting ancestor ACLsThe current ACL implementation will walk the tree from the item being accessed, up to the root, collecting ACL entries for all the ancestors. With this system, there is no easy way to restrict access to subnodes except by adding DENY entries to negate the entries inherited from the parent nodes.

I'd like to request a way to turn this behavior off either at a node level or global level.

The place where recursion is happening is in org.apache.jackrabbit.core.security.authorization.acl.ACLProvider$Entries.collectEntries(NodeImpl node). Inside this method, it could perhaps check a global parameter or the existence of property of the ACL policy node to determine whether to recurse up the tree."

0,"Some improvements to _TestUtil and its usageI've started this issue because I've noticed that _TestUtil.getRandomMultiplier() is called from many loops' condition check, sometimes hundreds and thousands of times. Each time it does Integer.parseInt after calling System.getProperty. This really can become a constant IMO, either in LuceneTestCase(J4) or _TestUtil, as it's not expected to change while tests are running ...

I then reviewed the class and spotted some more things that I think can be fixed/improved:
# getTestCodec() can become a constant as well
# arrayToString is marked deprecated. I've checked an no one calls them, so I'll delete them. This is a 4.0 code branch + a test-only class. No need to deprecate anything.
# getTempDir calls new Random(), instead of newRandom() in LuceneTestCaseJ4, which means that if something fails, we won't know the random seed used ...
#* In that regard, we might want to output all the classes that obtained a static seed in reportAdditionalFailures(), instead of just the class that ran the test.
# rmDir(String) can be removed IMO, and leave only rmDir(File)
# I suggest we include some recursion in rmDir(File) to handle the deletion of nested directories.
#* Also, it does not check whether the dir deletion itself succeeds (but it does so for the files). This can bite us on Windows, if some test did not close things properly.

I'll work out a patch."
0,"Spellchecker doesn't need to store ngramsThe spellchecker in contrib stores the ngrams although this doesn't seem to be necessary. This patch changes that, I will commit it unless someone objects. This improves indexing speed and index size. Some numbers on a small test I did:

Input of the original index: 2200 text files, index size 5.3 MB, indexing took 17 seconds

Spell index before patch: about 60.000 documents, index size 13 MB, indexing took 62 seconds
Spell index after patch: about 60.000 documents, index size 6.3 MB, indexing took 52 seconds

BTW, the test case fails even before this patch. I'll probaby submit another issue about how to fix that.

Provided fix is quite trivial - just wrap FileOutputStream into BufferedOutputStream.

0,"If IndexWriter hits OutOfMemoryError it should not commitWhile progress has been made making IndexWriter robust to OOME, I
think there is still a real risk that an OOME at a bad time could put
IndexWriter into a bad state such that if close() is called and
somehow it succeeds without hitting another OOME, it risks
introducing messing up the index.

I'd like to detect if OOME has been hit in any of the methods that
alter IW's state, and if so, do not commit changes to the index.  If
close is called after hitting OOME, I think writer should instead
abort.

Attached patch just adds try/catch clauses to catch OOME, note that
it was hit, and re-throw it.  Then, sync() refuses to commit a new
segments_N if OOME was hit, and close instead calls abort when OOME
was hit.  All tests pass.  I plan to commit in a day or two."

1,"Stale connection check does not work with IBM JSSE/JREOS: Windows/AIX
JRE: IBM JRE 1.4.1
JSSE: IBM's implementation (SSLite?)
HttpClient Library: 2.0.2 release

My code enabled connection pooling feature to gain performance improvement in 
the SSL Handshake area. The code works perfectly on Sun JRE 1.4.2 with a think 
time of 60seconds between requests, but the same code fails on IBM JRE. On IBM 
JRE, the code fails to detech stale connections, thus causing down the stream 
setSoTimeout() call to fail.

Further debugging into the library code revealed difference in the way the 
HTTPConnection.isStale() behaves. With in that method, particularly, the 
inputStream.isAvailable() method returns 0 with Sun JRE but -1 with IBM JRE.

I made a small code change to HttpConnection.isStale() method by moving the try
{}finally{} block outside of the if(inputStream.isAvailable()==0) check in the 
following code and BINGO, everything started working on IBM JVMs. It did not 
break anything on Suns JVM.

0,"[PATCH] FuzzyTermEnum optimization and refactorI took a look at it to see if it could be improved.  I saw speed improvements of
20% - 40% by making a couple changes.  

The patch is here: http://www.hagerfamily.com/patches/FuzzyTermEnumOptimizePatch.txt

The Patch is based on the HEAD of the CVS tree as of Oct 22, 2004.

What Changed?

Since the word was discarded if the edit distance for the word was
above a certain threshold, I updated the distance algorithm to abort
if at any time during the calculation it is determined that the best
possible outcome of the edit distance algorithm is above this
threshold.  The source code has a great explanation.

I also reduced the amount of floating point math, reduced the amount
of potential space the array takes in its first dimension, removed the
potential divide by 0 error when one term is an empty string, and
fixed a bug where an IllegalArgumentException was thrown if the class
was somehow initialized wrong, instead of looking at the arguments.

The behavior is almost identical.  The exception is that similarity is
set to 0.0 when it is guaranteed to be below the minimum similarity.

Results

I saw the biggest improvement from longer words, which makes a sense.
My long word was ""bridgetown"" and I saw a 60% improvement on this.
The biggest improvement are for words that are farthest away from the
median length of the words in the index.  Short words (1-3 characters)
saw a 30% improvement.  Medium words saw a 10% improvement (5-7
characters).  These improvements are with the prefix set to 0."
0,"upgrade contrib/ant's tidy.jarcontrib/ant uses a Tidy.jar that also includes classes in org.w3c.dom, org.xml.sax, etc.

This is no problem if you are an ant user, but if you are an IDE user you need to carefully configure the order of your classpath or things will not compile, as these will override the ones in the Solr libs, for example.

The solution is to upgrade the tidy.jar to the newest one that only includes org.w3c.tidy and doesn't cause these problems."

1,"Duplicate attribute in BeanDescriptor and CollectionDescriptor2 different attributes are used in BeanDescriptor and CollectionDescriptor to store the jcr type (jcrType and jcrNodeType). JcrNodeType can be removed. 
This imply modifications in  the DTD, the pm implementation and the different mapping xml files used for the unit tests. 

Furthermore, it should be nice to use the same name (jcrType)  in all descriptors.  There is a lot of confusion across the different descriptors. sometime jcrType is used, sometime jcrNodeType is used. I propose to use only jcrType with the following purpose : 

* In the ClassDescriptor, it  is used to store the primary node type of the class. 
* In the FieldDescriptor, it  is used to store the property type. 
* In the BeanDescriptor  it is used to defined the child node type. 
* In the CollectionDescriptor , it is used to defined the child node type. "

1,"Deadlock on version operations in a clustered environmentVersion operations in a cluster may end up in a deadlock: a write operation in the version store will acquire the version manager's write lock (N1.VW) and subsequently the cluster journal's write lock (N1.JW). Another cluster node's write operation in some workspace will acquire the journal's write lock (N2.JW) and first process the journal record log: if some of these changes concern the version store, the version manager's read lock (N2.VR) has to be acquired in order to deliver them. If the first cluster node reaches N1.VW, and the second reaches N2.JW, we have a deadlock. The same scenario takes place when the second cluster node synchronizes to the latest journal changes and reaches N2.JR, when the first cluster node is in N1.VW."
0,"Make ""boolean readOnly"" a required arg to IndexReader.openMost apps don't need read/write IndexReader, and, a readOnly
IndexReader has better concurrent performance.

I'd love to simply default readOnly to true, and you'd have to specify
""false"" if you want a read/write reader (I think that's the natural
default), but I think that'd break too many back-compat cases.

So the workaround is to make the parameter explicit, in 2.9.

I think even for IndexSearcher's methods that open an IndexReader
under the hood, we should also make the parameter explicit.

1,"InvalidItemStateException when attempting concurrent, non conflicting writesI'm having some problems doing concurrent addition of nodes to a parent node in Jackrabbit.  I've attached a simple test which starts up a bunch of threads which add nodes to a parent node concurrently.

0,"lock token validityThere are several minor issues in the mapping between JCR lock tokens and WebDAV lock tokens:

1) WebDAV lock tokens are supposed to use URI syntax (such as opaquelocktoken: or urn:uuid:)

2) The server currently computes lock tokens for session-scoped locks based on the node id; these are not valid JCR lock tokens though and cause exceptions when they are re-added when they appear in a Lock-Token header or an If header. This will likely cause requests to fail that use both types of locks (yes, maybe academic but should be fixed anyway)

Proposal:

a) Map lock tokens to oqaquelocktoken URIs, using a constant UUID plus a postfix encoding the original lock token
b) Use a syntax that allows to distinguish between tokens for open-scoped locks or session-scoped locks, so that we do not try to add the latter type to the Session (alternatively, handle exceptions doing so gracefully)"

0,"Add automatic default configurationWe should provide a simple way to start a Jackrabbit repository with default configuration. The current First Hops document exposes too much configuration details to be really friendly to first-time users.

I'd like to provide a default TransientRepository constructor that looks for ""repository.xml"" as the configuration file and ""repository"" as the repository home directory. If either of these does not exist, it is automatically created using default settings. This way the repository setup would boil down to:

    Repository repository = new TransientRepository();

As an added feature I'm planning to support system properties ""org.apache.jackrabbit.repository.conf"" and ""org.apache.jackrabbit.repository.home"" for overriding the defaults.

This improvement would make it easier to write and set up ""Hello, World!"" -type applications, thus helping interested people to try out Jackrabbit. This feature will also make it easier to provide a standard template for test classes that exhibit some error condition. Like this:

    import javax.jcr.*;
    import org.apache.jackrabbit.core.TransientRepository;
    public Example {
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            try {
                Repository repository = new TransientRepository();
                Session session = repository.login();
                try {
                    // YOUR CODE HERE
                } finally {
                    session.close();
                }
            } catch (Exception e) {
                e.printStackTRace();
            }
        }
    }

now the session used above that remapped the nt namespace has an ambigous namespace mapping:
foobar --> ""http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0""
""http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0"" --> foobar

    This lets us measure performance impact of sharing Field/Document

    own consumer that uses private threads).

  * Added merge.scheduler & merge.policy config options.

  * Added param for OptimizeTask, which expects an int and calls
    optimize(maxNumSegments) with that param.

  * Added param for CloseIndex(true|false) -- if you pass false that

0,"Use separate index for jcr:system treeCurrently each workspace index also includes index data of repository wide data (e.g. version nodes under jcr:system). There are several drawbacks with this approach:

- indexing is duplicated and does not scale when using a lot of workspaces
- workspaces cannot be 'put to sleep' when they are not actively used.

The repository should have an additional index for system data, which includes: versioning and nodetype representation in content. Basically data under /jcr:system.

Change the approach for how we buffer in RAM to a more isolated

in-process and when a doc needs to be indexed it's added to one of
them. Each segment would also write its own doc stores and
""normal"" segment merging (not the inefficient merge we now do on

0,"Improve contrib/benchmark for testing near-real-time search performanceIt's not easy to test NRT performance right now w/ contrib/benchmark.
I've made some initial fixes to improve this:

  * Added new '&', that can follow any task within a serial sequence,
    to ""background"" the task (just like a shell).  The test runs in
    the BG, and then at the end of all serial tasks, any still running
    BG tasks are stopped & joined.

  * Added WaitTask that simply waits; useful for controlling how long
    the BG'd tasks get to run.

  * Added RollbackIndex task, which is real handy for using a given
    index for an NRT test, doing a bunch of updates, then reverting it
    all so your next run uses the same starting index

  * Fixed the existing NearRealTimeReaderTask to simply periodically
    open the new reader (previously it was also running a fixed
    search), and removed its own threading (since & can do that
    now). It periodically wakes up, opens the new reader, and swaps it
    into the PerfRunData, at the schedule you specify.  I switched all
    usage of PerfRunData's get/setIndexReader APIs to use ref
    counting.

With these changes you can now make some very simple but powerful
algs, eg:

{code}
OpenIndex
{
  NearRealtimeReader(0.5) &
  # Warm
  Search
  { ""Index1"" AddDoc > : * : 100/sec &
  [ { ""Search"" Search > : * ] : 4 &
  Wait(30.0)
}
CloseReader
RollbackIndex
RepSumByName
{code}

This alg first opens the IndexWriter, then spawns the BG thread to
reopen the NRT reader twice per second, does one warming Search (in
the FG), spans a new thread to index documents at the rate of 100 per
second, then spawns 4 search threads that do as many searches as they
can.  We then wait for 30 seconds, then stop all the threads, revert
the index, and report.

The patch is a work in progress -- it generally works, but there're a
few nocommits, and, we may want to improve reporting (though I think
that's a separate issue).

0,"Redesign NodeInfo.getReferences()The method returns an array of PropertyIds. When there are lots of references this may become an problem. As with any other return value that potentially is large we should return an iterator.

I suggest to redesign the handling of references in line with recent discussions how child infos are handled.

- A NodeInfo implementation must either return the complete list of PropertyIds or null if it does not want to return the PropertyIds at that time.
- Introduce a new method: Iterator<PropertyId> RepositoryService.getReferences(SessionInfo, NodeId)

This has the following advantages:

- loading of references can be delayed until it is really needed
- large collections of references can be streamed through the SPI"

1,"Deadlock: IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[])A deadlock issue occurs under the following circumstances
- IndexWriter.autoCommit == true
- IndexWriter.directory contains multiple segments
- IndexWriter.AddIndex(IndexReader[]) is invoked

I put together a JUnit test that recreates the deadlock, which I've attached.  It is the first test method, 'testAddIndexByIndexReader()'.

In a nutshell, here is what happens:

        // 1) AddIndexes(IndexReader[]) acquires the write lock,
        // then begins optimization of destination index (this is
        // prior to adding any external segments).
        //
        // 2) Main thread starts a ConcurrentMergeScheduler.MergeThread
        // to merge the 2 segments.
        //
        // 3) Merging thread tries to acquire the read lock at
        // IndexWriter.blockAddIndexes(boolean) in
        // IndexWriter.StartCommit(), but cannot as...
        //
        // 4) Main thread still holds the write lock, and is

0,"Documentation Error for FilteredTermEnumAs pointed out in 
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=lucene-user@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=11034
the documentation of FilteredTermEnum.term() is wrong:
it says 
'Returns the current Term in the enumeration. Initially invalid, valid after
next() called for the first time.'
but the implementation of the constructors of the two derived classes
(FuzzyTermEnum and WildcardTermEnum) already initializes the object to point to
the first match. So calling next() before accessing terms will leave out the
first match.

So I suggest to replace the second sentance by something like
'Returns null if no Term matches or all terms have been enumerated.'
(I checked that for WildcardTermEnum only).
Further one might add some note to the docs of the constructors of FuzzyTermEnum
and WildcardTermEnum that they will point to the first element of the
enumeration (if any)."

Also, in the ctor, if an index exists and OpenMode is not CREATE, the creation time property is not read.

0,"default behaviour of useExpectHeaderI suggest to set the ExpectContinueMethod.setUseExpectHeader per default to
false or to arrange that per default it is not used. We lost an awfull lot of
time in a project in which we used MultipartPostMethod via a proxy. Everthing
worked fine in dev, however as soon as we started to use the proxy in production
or testing environment we had severe problems. We lost several manday looking
for the problem, including sniffing and logging op the proxy. It ended up to be
the useexpectheader which was true per default. Putting in on false ended our
problems...

In my opinion it is a bit hard to make something default behaviour if the
javadoc warns : <snip>
handshake should be used with caution, as it may cause problems with HTTP
servers and proxies that do not support HTTP/1.1 protocol.

1,"IndexDeletionPolicy.delete behaves incorrectly when deleting latest generation I have been looking to provide the ability to rollback committed transactions and encountered some issues.
I appreciate IndexDeletionPolicy's main motivation is to handle cleaning away OLD commit points but it does not explicitly state that it can or cannot be used to clean NEW commit points.

If this is not supported then the documentation should ideally state this. If the intention is to support this behaviour then read on .......

There seem to be 2 issues so far:
1) The first attempt to call IndexCommit.delete on the latest commit point fails to remove any contents. The subsequent call succeeds however
2) Deleting the latest commit point fails to update the segments.gen file to point to segments_N-1. New IndexReaders that are opened are then misdirected to open segments_N which has been deleted

http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=commons-httpclient-dev@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=5191
)
It is desirable for the http client to close it's connection after some
configurable idle time. Failing to do so causes the server (and every TCP
resource in between) to keep the socket open and possibly run out of resources
under load.

The HTTP 1.1 RFC has this to say under section 8.1.4:
Servers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will
   no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make
   this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making
   more connections through the same server. The use of persistent
   connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of
   this time-out for either the client or the server.

   When a client or server wishes to time-out it SHOULD issue a graceful
   close on the transport connection. Clients and servers SHOULD both
   constantly watch for the other side of the transport close, and
   respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server does not detect
   the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource
   drain on the network.

The first sentence of the 2nd paragraph is interesting: how is the client
supposed to do a ""graceful close""? Does it simply mean closing the socket?
One possiblity may be to issue a HTTP/OPTIONS * request with a Connection:close
header."

This may return false even if the Iso-format of both values are equal.

In other words: Creating a new DateValue using the ValueFactory from the String representation of an existing DateValue will return an object, that is not equal to the original DateValue. The reason for this is, that the String does not contain all infomation, that is used during Calendar.equals.

0,"Implement ""point in time"" searching without relying on filesystem semanticsThis was touched on in recent discussion on dev list:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/41700#41700

and then more recently on the user list:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/42088

Lucene's ""point in time"" searching currently relies on how the
underlying storage handles deletion files that are held open for
reading.

This is highly variable across filesystems.  For example, UNIX-like
filesystems usually do ""close on last delete"", and Windows filesystem
typically refuses to delete a file open for reading (so Lucene retries
later).  But NFS just removes the file out from under the reader, and
for that reason ""point in time"" searching doesn't work on NFS
(see LUCENE-673 ).

With the lockless commits changes (LUCENE-701 ), it's quite simple to
re-implement ""point in time searching"" so as to not rely on filesystem
semantics: we can just keep more than the last segments_N file (as
well as all files they reference).

This is also in keeping with the design goal of ""rely on as little as
possible from the filesystem"".  EG with lockless we no longer re-use
filenames (don't rely on filesystem cache being coherent) and we no
longer use file renaming (because on Windows it can fails).  This
would be another step of not relying on semantics of ""deleting open
files"".  The less we require from filesystem the more portable Lucene
will be!

Where it gets interesting is what ""policy"" we would then use for
removing segments_N files.  The policy now is ""remove all but the last
one"".  I think we would keep this policy as the default.  Then you
could imagine other policies:

  * Keep past N day's worth

  * Keep the last N

  * Keep only those in active use by a reader somewhere (note: tricky
    how to reliably figure this out when readers have crashed, etc.)

  * Keep those ""marked"" as rollback points by some transaction, or
    marked explicitly as a ""snaphshot"".

  * Or, roll your own: the ""policy"" would be an interface or abstract
    class and you could make your own implementation.

I think for this issue we could just create the framework
(interface/abstract class for ""policy"" and invoke it from
IndexFileDeleter) and then implement the current policy (delete all
but most recent segments_N) as the default policy.

In separate issue(s) we could then create the above more interesting
policies.

I think there are some important advantages to doing this:

  * ""Point in time"" searching would work on NFS (it doesn't now
    because NFS doesn't do ""delete on last close""; see LUCENE-673 )
    and any other Directory implementations that don't work
    currently.

  * Transactional semantics become a possibility: you can set a
    snapshot, do a bunch of stuff to your index, and then rollback to
    the snapshot at a later time.

  * If a reader crashes or machine gets rebooted, etc, it could choose
    to re-open the snapshot it had previously been using, whereas now
    the reader must always switch to the last commit point.

  * Searchers could search the same snapshot for follow-on actions.
    Meaning, user does search, then next page, drill down (Solr),
    drill up, etc.  These are each separate trips to the server and if
    searcher has been re-opened, user can get inconsistent results (=
    lost trust).  But with, one series of search interactions could
    explicitly stay on the snapshot it had started with.

Issue: IndexWriter.addIndexes results in java.lang.OutOfMemoryError for large

i.e. I keep repeating merges until a success. As my index size has grown, my

Take a look at the way the QUOTED token is constructed -- there is no lexical processing of the escaped characters within the quoted string itself. In the above query the lexer matches everything from the first quote through all the backslashes, _treating the end quote as an escaped character_, thus also matching the starting quote of the second term. This causes a lexer error, because the last quote is then considered the start of a new match.

I've come to understand that the Lucene query handler is supposed to be able to handle unsanitized human input; indeed the lexer above would handle a query like {{""blah\""}} without complaining, but that's a ""best-guess"" approach that results in bugs with legal, automatically generated queries. I've attached a patch that fixes the erroneous behavior but does not maintain leniency with malformed queries; I believe this is the correct approach because the two design goals are fundamentally at odds. I'd appreciate any comments."

0,"GCJ makefile hardcodes compiler commandssrc/gcj/Makefile hardcodes the command names for gcj, gcjh, and g++. This makes it difficult to 
compile with a particular version of GCJ if multiple are installed with suffixes (eg, gcj-4.0)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Configure, compile, and install GCC/GCJ with something like --program-suffix=-4.0
2. cd ~/src/lucene && ant gcj

Expected results:
Somehow be able to specify my compiler.

Actual results:
Can't find 'gcj' executable, or worse runs wrong version. :)

Suggested fix: as is common with variable names like CC to force a C compiler, allow the builder to 
override the compiler commands used by setting optional environment variables GCJ etc.

0,"Try harder to prevent SIGSEGV on cloned MMapIndexInputsWe are unmapping mmapped byte buffers which is disallowed by the JDK, because it has the risk of SIGSEGV when you access the mapped byte buffer after unmapping.

We currently prevent this for the main IndexInput by setting its buffer to null, so we NPE if somebody tries to access the underlying buffer. I recently fixed also the stupid curBuf (LUCENE-3200) by setting to null.

The big problem are cloned IndexInputs which are generally not closed. Those still contain references to the unmapped ByteBuffer, which lead to SIGSEGV easily. The patch from Mike in LUCENE-3439 prevents most of this in Lucene 3.5, but its still not 100% safe (as it uses non-volatiles).

This patch will fix the remaining issues by also setting the buffers of clones to null when the original is closed. The trick is to record weak references of all clones created and close them together with the original. This uses a ConcurrentHashMap<WeakReference<MMapIndexInput>,?> as store with the logic borrowed from WeakHashMap to cleanup the GCed references (using ReferenceQueue).

If we respin 3.5, we should maybe also get this in."
0,"FST should allow controlling how hard builder tries to share suffixesToday we have a boolean option to the FST builder telling it whether
it should share suffixes.

If you turn this off, building is much faster, uses much less RAM, and
the resulting FST is a prefix trie.  But, the FST is larger than it
needs to be.  When it's on, the builder maintains a node hash holding
every node seen so far in the FST -- this uses up RAM and slows things
down.

On a dataset that Elmer (see java-user thread ""Autocompletion on large
index"" on Jul 6 2011) provided (thank you!), which is 1.32 M titles
avg 67.3 chars per title, building with suffix sharing on took 22.5
seconds, required 1.25 GB heap, and produced 91.6 MB FST.  With suffix
sharing off, it was 8.2 seconds, 450 MB heap and 129 MB FST.

I think we should allow this boolean to be shade-of-gray instead:
usually, how well suffixes can share is a function of how far they are
from the end of the string, so, by adding a tunable N to only share
when suffix length < N, we can let caller make reasonable tradeoffs.

1,"Large Lucene index can hit false OOM due to Sun JRE issueThis is not a Lucene issue, but I want to open this so future google
diggers can more easily find it.

There's this nasty bug in Sun's JRE:

  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6478546

The gist seems to be, if you try to read a large (eg 200 MB) number of
bytes during a single RandomAccessFile.read call, you can incorrectly
hit OOM.  Lucene does this, with norms, since we read in one byte per
doc per field with norms, as a contiguous array of length maxDoc().

The workaround was a custom patch to do large file reads as several
smaller reads.

I would have expected one of the following instead:

2) Client re-requests the /something with authorization after 401-Unauthorized.

0,"Remove PropDefId and NodeDefIdthe PropDefIds and NodeDefIds are used to quickly lookup a childnode- or property definition in the nodetype registry (or effective nodetype).
this is heavily used during reading, when calling Property.getDefinition() usually when checking the isMultiple() flag. and of course while writing when getting the definition for the property or childnode. 

however, this poses problems when a nodetype is changed that is still used in the content. if a property definition is changed due to an altered nodetype, subsequent accesses to that property result in a ""invalid propdefid"" warning in the log - but the id is recomputed. this is especially a problem when upgrade jackrabbit from 1.x to 2.0, where some of the builtin nodetypes are defined differently.

i think that it should be feasible to remove the propdefids and nodedefids and compute the definition on demand. i think this can be implemented without performance loss, when some sort of 'signatures' of the items are computed to quickly find the definitions in the effective node type. furthermore, the most common usecase for using the property definition is probably the isMultiple() check - which is now on the Property interface itself - which does not need a definition lookup at all.

  public void testMergeCompressedFields() throws IOException {
    File indexDir = new File(System.getProperty(""tempDir""), ""mergecompressedfields"");
    Directory dir = FSDirectory.getDirectory(indexDir);
    try {
      for(int i=0;i<5;i++) {
        // Must make a new writer & doc each time, w/
        // different fields, so bulk merge of stored fields
        // cannot run:
        IndexWriter w = new IndexWriter(dir, new WhitespaceAnalyzer(), i==0, IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength.UNLIMITED);
        w.setMergeFactor(5);
        w.setMergeScheduler(new SerialMergeScheduler());
        Document doc = new Document();
        doc.add(new Field(""test1"", ""this is some data that will be compressed this this this"", Field.Store.COMPRESS, Field.Index.NO));
        doc.add(new Field(""test2"", new byte[20], Field.Store.COMPRESS));
        doc.add(new Field(""field"" + i, ""random field"", Field.Store.NO, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
        w.addDocument(doc);
        w.close();
      }

      byte[] cmp = new byte[20];

      IndexReader r = IndexReader.open(dir);
      for(int i=0;i<5;i++) {
        Document doc = r.document(i);
        assertEquals(""this is some data that will be compressed this this this"", doc.getField(""test1"").stringValue());
        byte[] b = doc.getField(""test2"").binaryValue();
        assertTrue(Arrays.equals(b, cmp));
      }
    } finally {
      dir.close();
      _TestUtil.rmDir(indexDir);

  }
{code}

0,"TCK: AbstractImportXmlTest incorrectly assumes mix:referenceable can be added to created nodeisMixRefRespected() assumes that if the NodeTypeManager contains mix:referenceable, addMixin can be called to add mix:referenceable to a created node.  This assumption is incorrect for at least two reasons.  First, the created node might already be mix:referenceable, either because its primary node type is a subtype of mix:referenceable or because the implementation added mix:referenceable as a mixin type in creating the node.  Second, a repository may restrict the nodes to which mix:referenceable can be added.  In the extreme case, the repository may not allow mix:referenceable to be added to any node using addMixin, in which case the only referenceable nodes would be those which are mix:referenceable by virtue of primary type or the implementation's adding mix:referenceable as a mixin type at node creation.

Proposal: test canAddMixin before calling addMixin.

1,"Possible HttpClient codepage issue (ascii/ebcdic) on WebSphere z/OSI am working with Cactus 1.4.1 on WebSphere NT and also WebSphere z/OS

I am trying to get basic cactus servlet tests working on WebSphere z/OS.
Everything works fine through WebSphere NT, however, when the same application
is deployed to WebSphere z/OS then we get the following error:

I have verified that the Application Server on WebSPhere z/OS is working fine. I
set the logging on the cactus to DEBUG and noticed that the data that the
HTTPClient is retrieving from the connection is scrambled in some way. For example:

16:06:20,213 [WebSphere t=009d7920] DEBUG ent.HttpClientConnectionHelper  -
>getCookieString = [null] 
16:06:20,317 [WebSphere t=009d7920] DEBUG httpclient.wire                 - >> ""ÇÅã@aã?¢£Ã?? etc...

On WebSphere NT the data at this point looks OK.

What springs to mind is maybe ascii/ebcdic conversion problem. z/OS uses unicode
 for java, as it should. However, the HTTPClient creates it own socket
connection to the app server and therefore it is connecting to non java code. In
such a situation codepage conversion is necessary.

Could anybody adsvise on how to get this to work?

1,"empty host header with ip addressfile: HttpMethodBase.java method: addHostRequestHeader

HttpClient writes an empty Host header if the host is referred using IP address.
HTTP 1.1 RFC is not too clear what should be used in this case. However, other
HTTP 1.1 implementations (e.g. Java 1.4.0) uses IP address instead of dns name
in the header.

Furthermore, some HTTP server implementations (e.g. Jetty) will return ""400 bad

it might be a good idea to use IP address in Host header to increase compability."
1,"addIndexesNoOptimize should not enforce maxMergeDocs/maxMergeSize limitIf you pass an index that has a segment > maxMergeDocs or maxMergeSize

But this check isn't reasonable because segment merging can easily
produce segments over these sizes since those limits apply to each
segment being merged, not to the final size of the segment produced.

So if you set maxMergeDocs to X, build up and index, then try to add
that index to another index that also has maxMergeDocs X, you can
easily hit the exception.

I think it's being too pedantic; I plan to just remove the checks for
sizes."
1,"Duplicate hits and missing hits in sorted searchIf using a searcher that subclasses from IndexSearcher I get different result sets (besides the ordering of course). The problem only occurrs if the searcher is wrapped by (Parallel)MultiSearcher and the index is not too small.

A closer look at the result sets revealed that the sorted search returns duplicate hits.

I created test cases for Lucene 1.4.3 as well as for the head release. The problem showed up for both, the number of duplicates beeing bigger for the head realease. The test cases are written for package org.apache.lucene.search. There are messages describing the problem written to the console. In order to see all those hints the asserts are commented out.

0,"Add deleteByQuery to IndexWriterThis has been discussed several times recently:

  http://markmail.org/message/awlt4lmk3533epbe
  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/57384#57384

If we add deleteByQuery to IndexWriter then this is a big step towards
allowing IndexReader to be readonly.

I took the approach suggested in that first thread: I buffer delete
queries just like we now buffer delete terms, holding the max docID
that the delete should apply to.

Then, I also decoupled flushing deletes (mapping term or query -->
actual docIDs that need deleting) from flushing added documents, and
now I flush deletes only when a merge is started, or on commit() or
close().  SegmentMerger now exports the docID map it used when
merging, and I use that to renumber the max docIDs of all pending
deletes.

Finally, I turned off tracking of memory usage of pending deletes
since they now live beyond each flush.  Deletes are now only
explicitly flushed if you set maxBufferedDeleteTerms to something
other than DISABLE_AUTO_FLUSH.  Otherwise they are flushed at the
start of every merge."

0,"Pass ClientConnectionManager to DefaultHttpClient constructorCopied from my mailing list post, Oleg suggested I post it to JIRA for 4.1 fix.

I'm trying to find the least verbose way of configuring a DefaultHttpClient with a ThreadSafeClientConnManager.

The example code given for this goes through a manual process of configuring HttpParams and SchemeRegistry objects, which is more or less copied from the DefaultHttpClient.createHttpParams() and createClientConnectionManager() methods.

It's a bit of a chicken and egg situation - DefaultHttpClient can create its own HttpParams and SchemeRegistry, which are themselves fine, but only once its been constructed, and the constructor requires the ThreadSafeClientConnManager, but that in turn requires the HttpParams and SchemeRegistry objects.  The only way out is to manually construct the HttpParams and SchemeRegistry, which is a waste.

It seems to me that DefaultHttpClient's constructor should take a ClientConnectionManagerFactory instead of a ClientConnectionManager. That way, the createClientConnectionManager() method already has the factory reference, and doesn't have to grub around in the HttpParams object to find it.

The code would then become:

new DefaultHttpClient(new ThreadSafeClientConnManagerFactory(), null);

where ThreadSafeClientConnManagerFactory.newInstance() just constructs ThreadSafeClientConnManager.  There's no manual construction of HttpParams and SchemeRegistry, you just leave it up to DefaultHttpClient.

0,"Some enhancements to jackrabbit commonsI would like to suggest a couple of  enhancements to the commons module. 

The patch was created against rev. 417443 and the tests did not reveal any 
problems.

Summary of suggestion modifications:

QName
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- reduce QName to its core functionality and put conversion from and to JCR name to
  a separate class 'NameFormat'
- in order not to break existing code, all methods that deal with the conversion in QName
  are marked deprecated.
- add constant for the name of the root node.

Path
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- reduce Path to its core functionality and put conversion from and to JCR path to
  a separate class 'PathFormat'
- in order not to break existing code, all methods that deal with the conversion in Path
  are marked deprecated.
- introduce new constants for UNDEFINED_INDEX (0) and DEFAULT_INDEX (1), that
   are currently hardcoded throughout  the jackrabbit project.
- new method Path.getElement(int) [PathElement]
- make PathElement constants public (used by PathFormat)

Path.PathBuilder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- additional constructor  PathBuilder(Path)

Path.PathElement
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add PathElement.getNormalizedIndex() that always asserts a 1-based index.
- change subclasses to be private (no usage within the jackrabbit, except inside Path).

PathMap
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- move o.a.j.core.PathMap  to o.a.j.util.PathMap in order to make it available in the
  commons module.

NamespaceResolver
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add methods for resolution of paths:
   > getQPath(String jcrPath) [Path]
   > getJCRPath(Path qPath) [String]

NamespaceListener
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add method 'namespaceRemove(String)'

ValueHelper
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
currently  JCR value objects are 'manually' created in the ValueHelper despite the
fact, that JSR170 defines a ValueFactory interface. Consequently the ValueHelper
present in the commons module can only be used by implementations that use
the same value implementations.

- add new helper methods that take a ValueFactory as argument.
- in order not to break existing code the original methods are marked deprecated and
  may be removed at a later time.

consequently:
- modify signature of  InternalValue.create that include a value conversion to take a
  ValueFactory param and adjust all usages inside the core package.

ValueFactoryImpl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- createValue(String, int ): used to call the conversion on ValueHelper. with the 
   changes suggested to ValueHelper, the code must be changed in order to
   created instances of the Value implementations within the factory.
- together with the modification to ValueHelper, stefan suggested to replace the public 
  constructor with a static 'getInstance' method. All usages within jackrabbit.core, were
   modified accordingly.

Text
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add getName(String, boolean) where the boolean flag indicates whether  a trailing slash 
   should be ignored.
- add getRelativeParent(String, int, boolean) where the boolean flag indicates whether  a 
  trailing slash should be ignored."
0,"Terms dict should block-encode termsWith PrefixCodedTermsReader/Writer we now encode each term standalone,
ie its bytes, metadata, details for postings (frq/prox file pointers),
etc.

But, this is costly when something wants to visit many terms but pull
metadata for only few (eg respelling, certain MTQs).  This is
particularly costly for sep codec because it has more metadata to
store, per term.

So instead I think we should block-encode all terms between indexed
term, so that the metadata is stored ""column stride"" instead.  This
makes it faster to enum just terms.

0,"jcr-server should honor a webdav request's Content-Type and Content-Language headerswhen processing a PUT or a POST, the DavResource should have access to the Content-Type and Content-Language headers presented in the webdav request, if any.

when the client explicitly communicates these headers, their values should take priority over server calculations (such as that done in SetContentTypeCommand), or at least be input into server calculations

furthermore, the dav getcontentlanguage is not at all supported by at least the simple webdav server.
"
0,"DateParser refactoring; Stateful cookie specsPresently DateParser is tightly coupled with the DefaultHttpParams class. I find
this sub-optimal from the design standpoint. Moreover, I believe that date
patterns should be specifiable at the method, host, and client levels, not only
global one. Currently this is not the case, and out of sync with the rest of the
preference framework, which can result in quite a bit of confusion.

When refactoring the DateParser class I also realized that the cookie specs were
shared by all the HttpMethod instances and as such had to be stateless. Even
though it is presently the case, technically there's nothing that prevents the
user from implementing a stateful cookie spec, plugging it into HttpClient, and
by doing so potentially causing quite unpleasant concurrency issues. Therefore,
I believe pluggable cookie specs MAY NOT be shared. There should be a cookie
spec instance created per method invocation

1,"Exception in deleteDocument, undeleteAll or setNorm in IndexReader can fail to release write lock on closeI hit this while working on LUCENE-140

We have 3 cases in the IndexReader methods above where we have this pattern:

  if (directoryOwner) acquireWriteLock();
  doSomething();
  hasChanges = true;

The problem is if you hit an exception in doSomething(), and hasChanges was not already true, then hasChanges will not have been set to true yet the write lock is held.  If you then try to close the reader without making any other changes, then the write lock is not released because in IndexReader.close() (well, in commit()) we only release write lock if hasChanges is true.

I think the simple fix is to swap the order of hasChanges = true and doSomething().  I already fixed one case of this under LUCENE-140 commit yesterday; I will fix the other two under this issue."
0,"Compressed fields should be ""externalized"" (from Fields into Document)Right now, as of 2.0 release, Lucene supports compressed stored fields.  However, after discussion on java-dev, the suggestion arose, from Robert Engels, that it would be better if this logic were moved into the Document level.  This way the indexing level just stores opaque binary fields, and then Document handles compress/uncompressing as needed.

This approach would have prevented issues like LUCENE-629 because merging of segments would never need to decompress.

See this thread for the recent discussion:

    http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/38836

0,"Single-pass grouping collector based on doc blocksLUCENE-3112 enables adding/updating a contiguous block of documents to
the index, guaranteed (yet, experimental!) to retain adjacent docID
assignment through the full life of the index as long the app doesn't
delete individual docs from the block.

When an app does this, it can enable neat features like LUCENE-2454
(nested documents), post-group facet counting (LUCENE-3097).

It also makes single-pass grouping possible, when you group by
the ""identifier"" field shared by the doc block, since we know we will
see a given group only once with all of its docs within one block.

This should be faster than the fully general two-pass collectors we
already have.

1,"Netscape proxy problem wtih POSTDescription:

When using httpClient to POST to a http url through a Netscape proxy server, 
the httpClient failed due to read error when reading status line.  The log seem 
to indicate that the proxy is talking HTTP/1.0 and does not expect the POST 
data to come.  I am using a modified version of the ClientApp from examples.  I 
will attach both the test program and log files.

Workaround:

If use PostMethod.setUseExpect (true), it will work.  But in many cases, it 
would be slower.

Related issues:

In doing the test, I also found out that the httpClient PostMehtod does not 
work when the request body is NOT set (not calling setRequestBody).  It also 
does not work with empty body (setRequestBody ("""")).  The attached 
clientApp.properties file has flags to test each case and I will attach the 
logs as well.  Excuse my ignorance, I do not know for sure what the HTTP spec. 
says about the body in the POST method.  But at least if the caller/app is 
wrong in not setting the body, some exception should be thrown.  It could also 
be my server's problem, please let me know if that is the case (I am using 
weblogic server 6.1)."

1,"Updates to multiple workspaces (e.g. in a transaction) locked in cluster journalRunning a transaction that updates multiple workspaces (e.g. a versioning operation) will be locked, as they all try to acquire a non-reentrant lock in the cluster's journal. Short-term fix is to make the lock re-entrant. In the long run, a transaction context sensitive lock may be more appropriate.

How to reproduce: enable clustering in the test environment and let the test o.a.j.core.XATest.testSetVersionLabel() run. This will result in a deadlock when committing the operation.

This was initially reported by Rafał Kwiecień as a problem when using springmodules and clustering but turned out to be general problem with transactions and clustering. Thanks for reporting it!"
0,"Benchmarks Enhancements (precision/recall, TREC, Wikipedia)Would be great if the benchmark contrib had a way of providing precision/recall benchmark information ala TREC.  I don't know what the copyright issues are for the TREC queries/data (I think the queries are available, but not sure about the data), so not sure if the is even feasible, but I could imagine we could at least incorporate support for it for those who have access to the data.  It has been a long time since I have participated in TREC, so perhaps someone more familiar w/ the latest can fill in the blanks here.

Another option is to ask for volunteers to create queries and make judgments for the Reuters data, but that is a bit more complex and probably not necessary.  Even so, an Apache licensed set of benchmarks may be useful for the community as a whole.  Hmmm.... 

Wikipedia might be another option instead of Reuters to setup as a download for benchmarking, as it is quite large and I believe the licensing terms are quite amenable.  Having a larger collection would be good for stressing Lucene more and would give many users a demonstration of how Lucene handles large collections.

At any rate, this kind of information could be useful for people looking at different indexing schemes, formats, payloads and different query strategies.

0,"davex remoting has  a performance bottleneck due limit of 2 http connectionsThe spi2dav service implementation use of HttpClient did not support configuration of the maximum amount of http connections to the server.  The default value, in the HttpClient code, is two. This was a performance bottleneck.  This work makes the number of connections configurable via a parameter to the map passed to the repository factory.  

It also fixes a concurrency issue which was exposed by the increased concurrency effected by this work.  This fix is a replacement of a HashMap cache of client connections with a ConcurrentHashMap, thanks to the java 1.5 available in Jackrabbit 2.x

USAGE: 
Set the number of connections (Spi2davRepositoryServiceFactory.PARAM_MAX_HTTP_CONNECTIONS) when creating a factory via the dav or davex rep factories.  Default is 20.

NOTE: 
See also the server side fixes: JCR-3027  The patch on that ticket allows configuration of the concurrency level on the server, which should be tuned in conjunction with the client side connection levels.

1,"Invalid journal records during XATransactionsDuring the prepare phase of a XATransaction, XAItemStateManager.prepare calls ShareItemStageManager.beginUpdate that, in case of a ClusterNode, calls ClusterNode.updatePrepared that does a ChangeLogRecord.write().

This last method is located in ClusterRecord and systematically write the begin and the end of the journal record.

As a consequence, useless corrupted records are written in the journal everytime a transaction ends without jackrabbit update! This causes polution of the journal, as other cluster nodes try to sync with the corrupted updates and fail doing so as ClusterRecordDeserializer can't deserialize it (the record identifier is empty).

ChangeLogRecord (and even other ClusterRecord implementations too) should only write if there's effective updates.

I propose the following solution:
*) add the following method in Changelog so clients can know if there's effective updates:
    public boolean hasUpdates() {
    	return !(addedStates.isEmpty() && modifiedStates.isEmpty() && deletedStates.isEmpty() && modifiedRefs.isEmpty());
    }

*) change ClusterRecord with:
    public final void write() throws JournalException {
    	
    	if (hasUpdates()) {
	        record.writeString(workspace);
	        doWrite();
	        record.writeChar(END_MARKER);
    	}
    }
    
    protected abstract boolean hasUpdates();

*) implement hasUpdates for every ClusterRecord implementation:
 ----> ChangeLogRecord:
    protected boolean hasUpdates() {
    	return changes.hasUpdates() || !events.isEmpty();
    }
 ----> LockRecord and NamespaceRecord:
    protected boolean hasUpdates() {
    	return true;
    }

 ----> NodeTypeRecord:
    protected boolean hasUpdates() {
    	return !collection.isEmpty();
    }

This interface does not refine the general contracts of the equals and hashCode methods. The result of comparing two objects that implement CharSequence is therefore, in general, undefined. Each object may be implemented by a different class, and there is no guarantee that each class will be capable of testing its instances for equality with those of the other. {color:red} It is therefore inappropriate to use arbitrary CharSequence instances as elements in a set or as keys in a map. {color}

We are running jackrabbit 1.4.5 using a persistent file data store within a weblogic container and encountering a variety of thread locking issues.

1,"Simple Webdav: dir with same name as repository has incorrect behaviorUsing a default repository named ""default"" for example, creating a directory named ""default"" in that repository will have issues.  The directory will not behave correctly. 

Viewing the dir in Jetty http://localhost:8080/jackrabbit/repository/default/default/ will show the contents of the ""default"" directory.  However, clicking on any of the contents will go to an incorrect URL.  E.g. if a directory named ""test"" was created, then the URL for test will be ""http://localhost:8080/jackrabbit/repository/default/test/""  instead of ""http://localhost:8080/jackrabbit/repository/default/default/test/"".

1,"PerFieldCodecWrapper causes crashes if not all per field codes have been usedIf a PerFieldCodecWrapper is used an SegmentMerger tries to merge two segments where one segment only has a subset of the field PerFieldCodecWrapper defines SegmentMerger tries to open non-existing files since Codec#files(Directory, SegmentInfo, Set<String>) blindly copies the expected files into the given set. This also hits exceptions in CheckIndex and addIndexes(). 
The reason for this is that PerFieldCodecWrapper simply iterates over the codecs it knows and adds all files without checking if they are present in the given Directory. We need to have some mechnanism that check if the ""required"" files for a codec are present and only add the files to the set if that field is really there.

0,"AbstractJCRTest fails on level 1 repositoriesIf a test case indicates that it's not read-only, org.apache.jackrabbit.test.AbstractJCRTest tries to cleanup the test root in the setUp method. This will cause the test case to fail, because a Level 1 repository will throw an UnsupportedOperationException here.

Proposal: before trying the cleanup, check for L2 functionality and throw a NotExecutableException otherwise:

            if (! isSupported(Repository.LEVEL_2_SUPPORTED)) {
              cleanUp();
              String msg = ""Test case requires level 2 functionality"";

0,"javacc on Win32 (cygwin) creates wrong line endings - fix them with 'ant replace'""ant javacc"" in Windows/Cygwin generates files with wrong line endings (\r  or \r\n instead of *Nix's \n). 
I managed to get rid of those using    perl -p -e 's/(\r\n|\n|\r)/\n/g'
Some useful info on line ending issues is in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline

After wasting some time to get rid of those, I modified javacc-QueryParser build.xml task to take care of that.
So now QueryParser files created with ""ant javacc"" are fixed (if required) to have \n as line ends.

Should probably do that also for the other javacc targets: javacc-HTMLParser and javacc-StandardAnalyzer(?)

What happens here is that when a version can not be instantiated, reload() is called, which in turn calls init(), which, as part of piece of code labeled ""fix legacy"" will call getSuccessors(), which in turn wants to instantiate versions.

0,"Queries with too many asterisks causing 100% CPU usageIf a search query has many adjacent asterisks (e.g. fo**************obar), I can get my webapp caught in a loop that does not seem to end in a reasonable amount of time and may in fact be infinite. For just a few asterisks the query eventually does return some results, but as I add more it takes a longer and longer amount of time. After about six or seven asterisks the query never seems to finish. Even if I abort the search, the thread handling the troublesome query continues running in the background and pinning a CPU.

0,"Make tests using java.util.Random reproducible on failureThis is a patch for LuceneTestCase to support logging of the Random seed used in randomized tests. The patch also includes an example implementation in TestTrieRangeQuery.

It overrides the protected method runTest() and inserts a try-catch around the super.runTest() call. Two new methods newRandom() and newRandom(long) are available for the test case. As each test case is run in an own TestCase object instance (so 5 test methods in a class instantiate 5 instances each method working in separate), the random seed is saved on newRandom() and when the test fails with any Throwable, a message with the seed (if not null) is printed out. If newRandom was never called no message will be printed.

This patch has only one problem: If a single test method calls newRandom() more than once, only the last seed is saved and printed out. But each test method in a Testcase should call newRandom() exactly once for usage during the execution of this test method. And it is not thread save (no sync, no volatile), but for tests it's unimportant.

I forgot to mention: If a test fails, the message using the seed is printed to stdout. The developer can then change the test temporarily:

{code}LuceneTestCase.newRandom() -> LuceneTestCase.newRandom(long){code}

using the seed from the failed test printout.

yes, but knowing a bug is there w/o having any idea what it is or how to 
trigger it can be very frustrating.

it would be enough for tests to pick a random number, log it, and then use 
it as the seed ... that way if you get a failure you at least know what 
seed was used and you can then hardcode it temporarily to reproduce/debug

0,"Item states cached in UpdatableItemStateManager not discarded on logoutThe SessionItemStateManager disposes only the TransientItemStateManager but not the UpdatableItemStateManager. The latter doesn't release the resources and the cached items keep listening the overlayed state events until the ReferenceMap do its magic. According to my tests in certain circumstances it slows down jackrabbit very much. 

In the charts you can see the time it takes to jackrabbit to save each child node. The first test uses a single session and the second creates a new session for each added node.

The patch I attach makes both tests take the same time. Opinions?

It seems that 'else' branch can be improved, at least by increasing log level. But I think, that best way is to throw exception.
Current message can also be misleading, in case when user type is correct but check Text.isDescendant fails.

Above method is called from within UserImporter#handlePropInfo

...
Authorizable a = userManager.getAuthorizable(parent);
if (a == null) {
     log.debug(""Cannot handle protected PropInfo "" + protectedPropInfo + "". Node "" + parent + "" doesn't represent a valid Authorizable."");
     return false;
} 
....

Here again log level is debug. Because at this point we have return statement, property 'principalName' is not set, and if we try to save session following exception will be thrown:

javax.jcr.nodetype.ConstraintViolationException: /home/public/users/b/bb2: mandatory property {internal}password does not exist

     at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.ItemImpl.save(ItemImpl.java:329)
    ...
 

So if the log level is not set to 'debug' it is not obvious why mentioned property is missing. Use case and root cause is that 'path' (/home/public/users/b/bb2)  is not descendant of 'usersPath' (/home/users).

0,"Completeness/Freshness of NamespaceRegistry and NodeTypeRegistryWe need to define the requirements on completeness and freshness of RepositoryService.getRegisteredNamespaces().

Right now the optimistic assumption seems to be that an SPI provider is able to report all namespaces that can occur in a repository beforehand. Even if it can do that (and I know of potential targets for SPI that simply can't), this seems to be quite a waste of time if these namespace prefixes aren't actually used later on.

Furthermore, in SPI namespace prefixes aren't really relevant, except to enable the transient layer to return ""meaningful"" prefixes instead of automatically generated ones.

Therefore my propoal would be to:

1) Clarify that the Map returned from getRegisteredNamespaces() isn't required to be complete,

2) Enhance JCR2SPI to auto-generate prefixes when it encounters namespaces not in the registry.

I expect this to also affect RepositoryService.(un)registerNamespace(...), but let's discuss the underlying issue first...

An entity with content type ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"" should be detected as form-url-encoded and parsed as such, honoring the specified character set. Currently the code requires an exact, case-insensitive match with ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" for an entity to be detected as form-url-encoded.

It appears that the author of URLEncodedUtils.parse(HttpEntity) tried to take character sets into account, but expected to find them in the Content-Encoding header instead of as a parameter in the Content-Length header. The HTTP 1.1 spec makes it clear that the Content-Encoding header is for specifying transformations like gzip compression or the identity transformation -- not for specifying the entity's character set.

0,"CharArraySet.clear()I needed CharArraySet.clear() for something I was working on in Solr in a tokenstream.

instead I ended up using CharArrayMap<Boolean> because it supported .clear()

it would be better to use a set though, currently it will throw UOE for .clear() because AbstractSet will call iterator.remove() which throws UOE.

In Solr, the very similar CharArrayMap.clear() looks like this:
{code}
  @Override
  public void clear() {
    count = 0;
    Arrays.fill(keys,null);
    Arrays.fill(values,null);
  }
{code}

I think we can do a similar thing as long as we throw UOE for the UnmodifiableCharArraySet

0,"Consolidate CustomScoreQuery, ValueSourceQuery and BoostedQuery Lucene's CustomScoreQuery and Solr's BoostedQuery do essentially the same thing: they boost the scores of Documents by the value from a ValueSource.  BoostedQuery does this in a direct fashion, by accepting a ValueSource. CustomScoreQuery on the other hand, accepts a series of ValueSourceQuerys.  ValueSourceQuery seems to do exactly the same thing as FunctionQuery.

With Lucene's ValueSource being deprecated / removed, we need to resolve these dependencies and simplify the code.

Therefore I recommend we do the following things:

- Move CustomScoreQuery (and CustomScoreProvider) to the new Queries module and change it over to use FunctionQuerys instead of ValueSourceQuerys.  
- Deprecate Solr's BoostedQuery in favour of the new CustomScoreQuery.  CSQ provides a lot of support for customizing the scoring process.

0,"PayloadsThis patch adds the possibility to store arbitrary metadata (payloads) together with each position of a term in its posting lists. A while ago this was discussed on the dev mailing list, where I proposed an initial design. This patch has a much improved design with modifications, that make this new feature easier to use and more efficient.

A payload is an array of bytes that can be stored inline in the ProxFile (.prx). Therefore this patch provides low-level APIs to simply store and retrieve byte arrays in the posting lists in an efficient way. 

API and Usage
------------------------------   
The new class index.Payload is basically just a wrapper around a byte[] array together with int variables for offset and length. So a user does not have to create a byte array for every payload, but can rather allocate one array for all payloads of a document and provide offset and length information. This reduces object allocations on the application side.

In order to store payloads in the posting lists one has to provide a TokenStream or TokenFilter that produces Tokens with payloads. I added the following two methods to the Token class:
  /** Sets this Token's payload. */
  public void setPayload(Payload payload);
  
  /** Returns this Token's payload. */
  public Payload getPayload();

In order to retrieve the data from the index the interface TermPositions now offers two new methods:
  /** Returns the payload length of the current term position.
   *  This is invalid until {@link #nextPosition()} is called for
   *  the first time.
   * 
   * @return length of the current payload in number of bytes
   */
  int getPayloadLength();
  
  /** Returns the payload data of the current term position.
   * This is invalid until {@link #nextPosition()} is called for
   * the first time.
   * This method must not be called more than once after each call
   * of {@link #nextPosition()}. However, payloads are loaded lazily,
   * so if the payload data for the current position is not needed,
   * this method may not be called at all for performance reasons.
   * 
   * @param data the array into which the data of this payload is to be
   *             stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new byte[] array
   *             is allocated for this purpose. 
   * @param offset the offset in the array into which the data of this payload
   *               is to be stored.
   * @return a byte[] array containing the data of this payload
   * @throws IOException
   */
  byte[] getPayload(byte[] data, int offset) throws IOException;

Furthermore, this patch indroduces the new method IndexOutput.writeBytes(byte[] b, int offset, int length). So far there was only a writeBytes()-method without an offset argument. 

Implementation details
------------------------------
- One field bit in FieldInfos is used to indicate if payloads are enabled for a field. The user does not have to enable payloads for a field, this is done automatically:
   * The DocumentWriter enables payloads for a field, if one ore more Tokens carry payloads.
   * The SegmentMerger enables payloads for a field during a merge, if payloads are enabled for that field in one or more segments.
- Backwards compatible: If payloads are not used, then the formats of the ProxFile and FreqFile don't change
- Payloads are stored inline in the posting list of a term in the ProxFile. A payload of a term occurrence is stored right after its PositionDelta.
- Same-length compression: If payloads are enabled for a field, then the PositionDelta is shifted one bit. The lowest bit is used to indicate whether the length of the following payload is stored explicitly. If not, i. e. the bit is false, then the payload has the same length as the payload of the previous term occurrence.
- In order to support skipping on the ProxFile the length of the payload at every skip point has to be known. Therefore the payload length is also stored in the skip list located in the FreqFile. Here the same-length compression is also used: The lowest bit of DocSkip is used to indicate if the payload length is stored for a SkipDatum or if the length is the same as in the last SkipDatum.
- Payloads are loaded lazily. When a user calls TermPositions.nextPosition() then only the position and the payload length is loaded from the ProxFile. If the user calls getPayload() then the payload is actually loaded. If getPayload() is not called before nextPosition() is called again, then the payload data is just skipped.
  
Changes of file formats
------------------------------
- FieldInfos (.fnm)
The format of the .fnm file does not change. The only change is the use of the sixth lowest-order bit (0x20) of the FieldBits. If this bit is set, then payloads are enabled for the corresponding field. 

- ProxFile (.prx)
ProxFile (.prx) -->  <TermPositions>^TermCount
TermPositions   --> <Positions>^DocFreq
Positions       --> <PositionDelta, Payload?>^Freq
Payload         --> <PayloadLength?, PayloadData>
PositionDelta   --> VInt
PayloadLength   --> VInt 
PayloadData     --> byte^PayloadLength

For payloads disabled (unchanged):
PositionDelta is the difference between the position of the current occurrence in the document and the previous occurrence (or zero, if this is the first   occurrence in this document).
  
For Payloads enabled:
PositionDelta/2 is the difference between the position of the current occurrence in the document and the previous occurrence. If PositionDelta is odd, then PayloadLength is stored. If PositionDelta is even, then the length of the current payload equals the length of the previous payload and thus PayloadLength is omitted.

- FreqFile (.frq)

SkipDatum     --> DocSkip, PayloadLength?, FreqSkip, ProxSkip
PayloadLength --> VInt

For payloads disabled (unchanged):
DocSkip records the document number before every SkipInterval th document in TermFreqs. Document numbers are represented as differences from the previous value in the sequence.

For payloads enabled:
DocSkip/2 records the document number before every SkipInterval th  document in TermFreqs. If DocSkip is odd, then PayloadLength follows. If DocSkip is even, then the length of the payload at the current skip point equals the length of the payload at the last skip point and thus PayloadLength is omitted.


This encoding is space efficient for different use cases:
   * If only some fields of an index have payloads, then there's no space overhead for the fields with payloads disabled.
   * If the payloads of consecutive term positions have the same length, then the length only has to be stored once for every term. This should be a common case, because users probably use the same format for all payloads.
   * If only a few terms of a field have payloads, then we don't waste much space because we benefit again from the same-length-compression since we only have to store the length zero for the empty payloads once per term.

All unit tests pass."

0,"revise max-per-host configurationMax-per-host settings for ThreadSafeClientConnManagers are currently stored in HttpParams, where the parameter value is a map from HttpRoute (formerly HostConfiguration) to Integer. This has several drawbacks:

1) maintaining a map as a value in HttpParams doesn't match my understanding of how params should be used
2) the maximums based on HttpRoute are really specific to the TSCCM implementation and not a generic parameterization

some of the options are:

a) revise to define a more generic parameterization approach
b) revise into an implementation specific parameterization approach
c) define an implementation (TSCCM) specific configuration interface and a default implementation keeping the map as run-time data

"
0,"Post grouping facetingThis issues focuses on implementing post grouping faceting.
* How to handle multivalued fields. What field value to show with the facet.
* Where the facet counts should be based on
** Facet counts can be based on the normal documents. Ungrouped counts. 
** Facet counts can be based on the groups. Grouped counts.
** Facet counts can be based on the combination of group value and facet value. Matrix counts.   

And properly more implementation options.

The first two methods are implemented in the SOLR-236 patch. For the first option it calculates a DocSet based on the individual documents from the query result. For the second option it calculates a DocSet for all the most relevant documents of a group. Once the DocSet is computed the FacetComponent and StatsComponent use one the DocSet to create facets and statistics.  

This last one is a bit more complex. I think it is best explained with an example. Lets say we search on travel offers:
|||hotel||departure_airport||duration||
|Hotel a|AMS|5
|Hotel a|DUS|10
|Hotel b|AMS|5
|Hotel b|AMS|10

If we group by hotel and have a facet for airport. Most end users expect (according to my experience off course) the following airport facet:
AMS: 2
DUS: 1

The above result can't be achieved by the first two methods. You either get counts AMS:3 and DUS:1 or 1 for both airports."

The problem there was, that the SO_TIMEOUT was not set on the socket before the connection was established through the SOCKS proxy. This lead to a stop on the native read0 method because the socket is endlessly waiting for a read to occur from the proxy, so it can continue with the the connect to the actual socket destination through the proxy. I made sure I set the SO_TIMEOUT parameter in HttpParams, but it did not get honored by PlainSocketFactory.

To fix this and make HttpClient honor SO_TIMEOUT for SOCKS proxies, the following line has to be added:
  sock.setSoTimeout(HttpConnectionParams.getSoTimeout(params));
in PlainSocketFactory.connectSocket(...).

Heres the complete fixed method:

PlainSocketFactory:            
    public Socket connectSocket(
            final Socket socket,
            final InetSocketAddress remoteAddress,
            final InetSocketAddress localAddress,
            final HttpParams params) throws IOException, ConnectTimeoutException {
        if (remoteAddress == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Remote address may not be null"");
        }
        if (params == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""HTTP parameters may not be null"");
        }
        Socket sock = socket;
        if (sock == null) {
            sock = createSocket();
        }
        if (localAddress != null) {
            sock.setReuseAddress(HttpConnectionParams.getSoReuseaddr(params));
            sock.bind(localAddress);
        }
        
        //FIX for SOCKS proxies which get stalled if they don't answer
        sock.setSoTimeout(HttpConnectionParams.getSoTimeout(params));
        
        int timeout = HttpConnectionParams.getConnectionTimeout(params);
        try {
            sock.connect(remoteAddress, timeout);
        } catch (SocketTimeoutException ex) {
            throw new ConnectTimeoutException(""Connect to "" + remoteAddress.getHostName() + ""/""
                    + remoteAddress.getAddress() + "" timed out"");
        }
        return sock;
    }

Currently I've implemented this in my delegating SchemeSocketFactory, because PlainSocketFactory misses this setting.

Dunno if there are other implementations of SocketFactory in HttpClient, which might need this fix. Anyway I hope this helps other people who get  headaches about halting threads because they use SOCKS proxies. :)"
0,Faster packaging of the standalone jarCurrently the standalone jar is created by first unpacking all the dependencies to target/classes and then packaging the resulting directory tree into the resulting jar file. This takes quite a while as all the writing and reading of uncompressed class files requires lots of disk IO. We could avoid these extra copies by using the bundle or assembly plugin to build the standalone jar.

extending the check to:

0,"drop java 5 ""support""its been discussed here and there, but I think we need to drop java 5 ""support"", for these reasons:
* its totally untested by any continual build process. Testing java5 only when there is a release candidate ready is not enough. If we are to claim ""support"" then we need a hudson actually running the tests with java 5.
* its now unmaintained, so bugs have to either be hacked around, tests disabled, warnings placed, but some things simply cannot be fixed... we cannot actually ""support"" something that is no longer maintained: we do find JRE bugs (http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/SunJavaBugs) and its important that bugs actually get fixed: cannot do everything with hacks.
* because of its limitations, we do things like allow 20% slower grouping speed. I find it hard to believe we are sacrificing performance for this.

So, in summary: because we don't test it at all, because its buggy and unmaintained, and because we are sacrificing performance, I think we need to cutover the build system for the next release to require java 6.

0,"Contrib: another highlighter approachMark Harwoods highlighter package is a great contribution to Lucene, I've used it a lot! However, when you have *large* documents (fields), highlighting can be quite time consuming if you increase the number of bytes to analyze with setMaxDocBytesToAnalyze(int). The default value of 50k is often too low for indexed PDFs etcetera, which results in empty highlight strings.

This is an alternative approach using term position vectors only to build fragment info objects. Then a StringReader can read the relevant fragments and skip() between them. This is a lot faster. Also, this method uses the *entire* field for finding the best fragments so you're always guaranteed to get a highlight snippet.

Because this method only works with fields which have term positions stored one can check if this method works for a particular field using following code (taken from TokenSources.java):

        TermFreqVector tfv = (TermFreqVector) reader.getTermFreqVector(docId, field);
        if (tfv != null && tfv instanceof TermPositionVector)
        {

        }

0,"Make not yet final core/contrib TokenStream/Filter implementations finalLucene's analysis package is designed in a way, that you can plug different *implementations* of analysis in chains of TokenStreams and TokenFilters. An analyzer is build of several TokenStreams/Filters that do the tokenization of text. If you want to modify the behaviour of tokenization, you implement a new subclass of TokenStream/-Filter/Tokenizer.

Most classes in the core are correctly implemented like that. They are itsself final or their implementation methods are final (CharTokenizer).

A lot of problems with backwards-compatibility of LUCENE-1693 are some classes in Lucene's core/contrib not yet final:
- KeywordTokenizer should be declared final or its implementation methods should be final
- StandardTokenizer should be declared final or its implementation methods should be final
- ISOLatin1Filter is deprecated, so it will be removed in 3.0, nothing to do.

CharTokenizer is the abstract base class of several other classes. The design is correct: Child classes cannot override the implementation, they can only change the behaviour of this final implementation.

Contrib should be checked, that all implementation classes are at least final or they are designed in the same way like CharTokenizer."

0,"Tiered flushing of DWPTs by RAM with low/high water marksNow that we have DocumentsWriterPerThreads we need to track total consumed RAM across all DWPTs.

A flushing strategy idea that was discussed in LUCENE-2324 was to use a tiered approach:  
- Flush the first DWPT at a low water mark (e.g. at 90% of allowed RAM)
- Flush all DWPTs at a high water mark (e.g. at 110%)
- Use linear steps in between high and low watermark:  E.g. when 5 DWPTs are used, flush at 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% and 110%.

Should we allow the user to configure the low and high water mark values explicitly using total values (e.g. low water mark at 120MB, high water mark at 140MB)?  Or shall we keep for simplicity the single setRAMBufferSizeMB() config method and use something like 90% and 110% for the water marks?"

1,"NullPointerException from SegmentInfos.FindSegmentsFile.run() if FSDirectory.list() returns NULL Found this bug while running unit tests to verify an upgrade of our system from 1.4.3 to 2.1.0.  This bug did *not* occur during 1.4.3, it is new to 2.x (I'm pretty sure it's 2.1-only)

If the index directory gets deleted out from under Lucene after the FSDirectory has been created, then attempts to open an IndexWriter or IndexReader will result in an NPE.  Lucene should be throwing an IOException in this case.

Repro:
    1) Create an FSDirectory pointing somewhere in the filesystem (e.g. /foo/index/1)
    2) rm -rf the parent dir (rm -rf /foo/index)
    3) Try to open an IndexReader

Result: NullPointerException on line ""for(int i=0;i<files.length;i++) { "" -- 'files' is NULL.
 
Expect: IOException


....  

This is happening because of a missing NULL check in SegmentInfos$FindSegmentsFile.run():

        if (0 == method) {
          if (directory != null) {
            files = directory.list();
          } else {
            files = fileDirectory.list();

            throw new FileNotFoundException(""no segments* file found: files:"" + s);

The FSDirectory constructor will make sure the index dir exists, but if it is for some reason deleted out from underneath Lucene after the FSDirectory is instantiated, then java.io.File.list() will return NULL.

Then the reading session tries to create an overlayed ItemState for the LocalItemStateManager using the changed status.

Adding the STATUS_UNDEFINED to the list of 'valid' status in the ItemState constructor seems to solve the issue, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it.

is also never gc'd.  While I think we can avoid this problem in our code, in the
more general case, clients may not actually be able to control the number of

0,"IndexWriter.getReader() allocates file handlesI am not sure if this is a ""bug"" or really just me not reading the Javadocs right...

The IR returned by IW.getReader() leaks file handles if you do not close() it, leading to starvation of the available file handles/process. If it was clear from the docs that this was a *new* reader and not some reference owned by the writer then this would probably be ok. But as I read the docs the reader is internally managed by the IW, which at first shot lead me to believe that I shouldn't close it.

So perhaps the docs should be amended to clearly state that this is a caller-owns reader that *must* be closed? Attaching a simple app that illustrates the problem."

1,"ConnPoolByRoute driving RouteSpecificPool to IllegalStateHi all,

I encountered an issue on ConnPoolByRoute / RouteSpecificPool on HTTPClient 4.0.1, akin to HTTPCLIENT-747 (it also leads to a java.lang.IllegalStateException: No entry created for this pool. HttpRoute[{}XXX] ), but it is not a concurrency issue (no race condition, just a logic error if I understood it correctly).

From my understanding, the error lies in ConnPoolByRoute#getEntryBlocking
Quoting from the code (line 309-314) :
RouteSpecificPool rospl = getRoutePool(route, true);
... 
} else if (hasCapacity && !freeConnections.isEmpty()) {

deleteLeastUsedEntry();
entry = createEntry(rospl, operator);

} else { ...

The short version of the issue is : under certain circumstances, #deleteLeastUsedEntry can remove rospl from the map of known RootSpecificPool. But as this code still holds on to the rospl instance, it will modify its state in a way the pool will never recover from later, not having any other way to access this instance when the connection gets released.

A Step by Step guide to what's going wrong.
0) You have to be in a condition that leads to the execution of said code extract (i.e. no free entry on the current route - but the route already is registered to the global pool -, current Route has capacity, max connections reached for the global pool, but there are free connections to destroy).
2) We arrive in deleteLeastUsedEntry(). We get the last entry from a queue. It can be that this entry is bound to the same (hashCode() wise) Route that the one we are getting a connection to (i.e. rospl instance held in the #getEntryBlocking context)
3) this entry can be the last of its pool, thus at this point, rospl.isUnused() == true
4) As a consequence, deleteEntry() will remove rospl from the routeToPool map
5) Back in the getEntryBlocking method, we do entry = createEntry(rospl, operator), which will do createdEntry() on the ""locally-scoped"" rospl instance that has just been removed from routeToPool 
6) When the connexion from this new entry is released at some point in the future, the rospl instance that got the createdEntry() does not exist anymore, and it is a new one that gets the freeEntry() call
7) App breaks : this newly created RouteSpecificPool throws IllegalStateException.

Step 0, though, is a rare condition that I only reached during stress tests, and on a SSL client-auth server. This is so because this is the only condition that I know of in HTTPClient, where there is a keep-alive connection in the RouteSpecificPool that can not be reused (when the State is set to the X500 principals of the client cert in the pool, but not in the request).

Possible fix (from what I understand) :
The rospl instance variable in the context of getEntryBlocking() should be protected against the consequences of #deleteLeastUsedEntry().
Not being confortable with all issues at hand, nor with the code base, the simplest thing I can think of would be to preemptively reset the rospl variable after deleteLeastUsedEntry(), thus writing the previous code extract as :

} else if (hasCapacity && !freeConnections.isEmpty()) {

deleteLeastUsedEntry();
// delete may have made deprecated the RouteSpecificPool instance
rospl = getRoutePool(route, true);
entry = createEntry(rospl, operator);

} else { ...


I have a test case that I will attach to this issue ASAP.
It is a simple example that triggers the above conditions with 3 HttpGet calls, in a serial fashion. As stated previsouly, these calls need nothing particular, except that one of these calls must go to a HTTPS server with client-side certificate authentication (I guess NTLM would be OK, anything that will place a non null state along with the route in BasicEntryPool).

I hope code is self-explainatory. I get 100% failure in my setup. Just configure your 2 URLS, configure classpath, set your keystores system properties, and launch.

Workaround :
Best workaround I found is : do not get to step 0.
The most robust way I found to do that (i.e. a way that does not involve things like setting max pool size to a gigantic number that can never be reached, ...) is to actively set the ClientContext.USER_TOKEN attribute in an exec context while submitting the request to the client.
Step 0 triggers when there is an idle connection that waits, and when this idle connection can not be reused, which can only happen if the request's ""USER_TOKEN"" does not match the BasicPoolEntry#getState(). As, in the SSL case, the state is the SSL Cert's X500PrincipalName, and I know it in advance, it's easy to set up front.

By the way, this taught me that I never could benefit from connection reuse strategies in this SSL case, as connections would always get into the pool with a USER_TOKEN that my requests never had. Don't know if it's mentionned somewhere in the documentation, but this is a noteworthy fact to me.

0,"More clarification, improvements and correct behaviour of backwards testsBackwards tests are used since 2.9 to assert, that the new Lucene version supports drop-in-replacement over the previous version. For this all tests from the previous version are compiled against the old version but then run against the new JAR file.

At the beginning the test suite was checking out another branch and doing this, but this was replaced in 3.1 by directly embedding the previous source tree and the previous tests into the backwards/ subdirectory of the SVN source. The whole idea has several problems:

- Tests not only check *public* APIs, they also check internals and sometimes even fields or package-private methods. This is allowed to change in later versions, so we must be able to change the tests, to support this behaviour. This can be done by modifying the backwards tests to pass, but still use the public API unchanged. Sometimes we simply comment out tests, that test internals and not public APIs. For those tests, I would like to propose a Java Annotation for trunk tests like @LuceneInternalTest - so we can tell the tests runner for backwards (when this test is moved as backwards layer, e.g in 4.1, that it runs all tests *but* not this marked one. This can be done easily with Junit3/4 in LuceneTestCase(J4). This is not part of this issue, but a good idea.
- Sometimes we break backwards compatibility. Currently we do our best to change the tests to reflect this, but this is unneeded and stupi, as it brings two problems. The backwards tests should be compiled against the old version of Lucene. If we change this old Version in the backwards folder, its suddenly becomes nonsense. At least the JAR artifacts of the previous version should stay *unchanged* in all cases! If we break backwards, the correct way to do this, is to simply disable coresponding tests! There is no need to make them work again, as we broke backwards, wy test plugin? The trunk tests already check the functionality, backwards tests only check API. If we fix the break in backwards, we do the contra of what they are for.

So I propose the following and have implemented in a patch for 3.x branch:

- Only include the *tests* and nothing else into the backwards branch, no source files of previous Lucene Core.
- Add the latest released JAR artifact of lucene-core.jar into backwards/lib, optimally with checksum (md5/sh1). This enforces that it is not changed and exactly do what they are for: To compile the previous tests against. This is the only reason for this JAR file.
- If we break backwards, simply *disable* the tests by commenting out, ideally with a short note and the JIRA issue that shows the break.
- If we change inner behaviour of classes, that are not public, dont fix, disable tests. Its simple: backwards tests are only for API compatibility testsing of public APIs. If a test uses internals it should not be run. For that we should use a new annotation in trunk (see above).

This has several good things:

- we can package backwards tests in src ZIP. Its not a full distrib, only the core tests and the JAR file. This enables people that doenloaded the src ZIP files to also run backwrads tests
- Your SVN checkout is not so big and backwards tests run faster!

There are some problems, with one example in the attached patch:

- If we have mock classes in the tests (e.g. MockRAMDirectory) that extend Lucene classes and have access to their internal APIs, a change in these APIs will make them fail to work unchanged. The above example (MockRAMDir) is used in lots of tests and uses a internal RAMDir field that changed type in 3.1. But we cannot disable all tests using this dir (no tests will survive). As we cannot change the previous versions JAR to reflect this, you have to use some trick in this interbal test class. In this case I removed static linking of this field and replaced by reflection. This enables compilation against old JAR, but supports running in new version. This is really a special case, but works good here.

Any comments?"
0,"Provide possibility to import protected items using Session import functionalitySessionImporter and WorkspaceImporter currently skip all protected items encountered during import except for some special cases
(see JCR-2172 and WorkspaceImporter#postProcessNode).
The specification only mandates that protected content is treated in a consistent manner, but allows the implementation to either import or ignore it.

Find attached a patch containing some initials steps to allow to extend the default import behavior:
Instead of skipping protected items (and in case of nodes the complete tree below it), they should be passed to a separate handler,
that may or may not be able to deal with them and needs to assert, that they are in a valid format.

The patch includes:

- Abstract classes for that protected item import
- Default implementations that never import protected nodes (same behavior as we have today)
- An example implementation for the AC-content (just to see if it works for simple cases) + some trivial tests.
- Changes to SessionImporter to demonstrate how import of protected items would be enabled.

The patch doesn't include yet:

- Changes to WorkspaceImporter (would +- be according to SessionImporter)
- Changes to WorkspaceImpl/SessionImpl as well as configuration that would allow to modify the default behavior.
- Examples for import of protected properties.
- Examples for workspace import.

The patch has the following limitations or TODOs:

- Proper handling of protected references properties or non-protected ref properties with the tree defined by a protected node.
- Test / Careful review if the various ImportUUIDBehaviors are/can properly be covered, specially in case of ""replace-existing"".

The patch in addition addresses:

- An inconsistency in the SessionImporter:
  > Attempt to import protected content below an existing protected node => skipped
  > Attempt to import protected content that doesn't yet exist => first node is imported, ConstraintViolationException for child-nodes.
  > This behavior is also reflected in the Node-stack... where in the first case 'null' is pushed, in the second case the first protected node.

0,"fail build if contrib tests fail to compilespinoff of LUCENE-885, from Steven's comments...

Looking at the current build (r545324) it looks like the some contrib failures are getting swallowed. Things like lucli are throwing errors along the lines of

 [subant] /home/barronpark/smparkes/work/lucene/trunk/common-build.xml:366: srcdir ""/home/barronpark/smparkes/work/lucene/trunk/contrib/lucli/src/test"" does not exist!

but these don't make it back up to the top level status.

It looks like the current state will bubble up junit failures, but maybe not build failures?

...

It's ""test-compile-contrib"" (if you will) that fails and rather being contrib-crawled, that's only done as the target of ""test"" in each contrib directory, at which point, it's running in the protected contrib-crawl.

Easy enough to lift this loop into another target, e.g., build-contrib-test. And that will start surfacing errors, which I can work through.

1,"Don't leak deleted open file handles with pooled readersIf you have CFS enabled today, and pooling is enabled (either directly
or because you've pulled an NRT reader), IndexWriter will hold open
SegmentReaders against the non-CFS format of each merged segment.

So even if you close all NRT readers you've pulled from the writer,
you'll still see file handles open against files that have been
deleted.

This count will not grow unbounded, since it's limited by the number
of segments in the index, but it's still a serious problem since the
app had turned off CFS in the first place presumably to avoid risk of
too-many-open-files.  It's also bad because it ties up disk space
since these files would otherwise be deleted.
"
0,"Performance improvement for SegmentMerger.mergeNorms()This patch makes two improvements to SegmentMerger.mergeNorms():

1) When the SegmentMerger merges the norm values it allocates a new byte array to buffer the values for every field of every segment. The size of such an array equals the size of the corresponding segment, so if large segments are being merged, those arrays become very large, too.
We can easily reduce the number of array allocations by reusing a byte array to buffer the norm values that only grows, if a segment is larger than the previous one.

2) Before a norm value is written it is checked if the corresponding document is deleted. If not, the norm is written using IndexOutput.writeByte(byte[]). This patch introduces an optimized case for segments that do not have any deleted docs. In this case the frequent call of IndexReader.isDeleted(int) can be avoided and the more efficient method IndexOutput.writeBytes(byte[], int) can be used.


This patch only changes the method SegmentMerger.mergeNorms(). All unit tests pass."

1,"IndexMerger throws null pointer exception without stacktraceI get the following errors in my log file randomly.  It seems to happen most often when creating the lucene indices, but has happened at other times as well:

[IndexMerger] ERROR - Error while merging indexes: java.lang.NullPointerException

The code at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.IndexMerger line 344 appears to be the point where the error is logged, but no other information is provided because the throwable isn't sent to the log (only the toString() version of the exception).  I haven't been able to tell if any indexes are corrupt when this happens.

I suggest that the logger be changed to determine where the null pointer is coming from first, then resolve the actual issue that is occurring.
"
0,"Massive Code Duplication in Contrib Analyzers - unifly the analyzer ctorsDue to the variouse tokenStream APIs we had in lucene analyzer subclasses need to implement at least one of the methodes returning a tokenStream. When you look at the code it appears to be almost identical if both are implemented in the same analyzer.  Each analyzer defnes the same inner class (SavedStreams) which is unnecessary.
In contrib almost every analyzer uses stopwords and each of them creates his own way of loading them or defines a large number of ctors to load stopwords from a file, set, arrays etc.. those ctors should be removed / deprecated and eventually removed.

1,"MoreLikeThis reuses a reader after it has already closed itMoreLikeThis has a fatal bug whereby it tries to reuse a reader for multiple fields:

        String fieldName = fieldNames[i];

However, addTermFrequencies() is creating a TokenStream for this reader:

My first thought was that it seems like a ""ReaderFactory"" of sorts should be passed in so that a new Reader can be created for the second field (maybe the factory could be passed the field name, so that if someone wanted to pass a different reader to each, they could.)

Interestingly, the methods taking File and URL exhibit the same issue.  I'm not sure what to do about those (and we're not using them.)  The method taking File could open the file twice, but the method taking a URL probably shouldn't fetch the same URL twice.

0,"Add matchVersion to StandardAnalyzerI think we should add a matchVersion arg to StandardAnalyzer.  This
allows us to fix bugs (for new users) while keeping precise back
compat (for users who upgrade).

We've discussed this on java-dev, but I'd like to now make it concrete
(patch attached).  I think it actually works very well, and is a
simple tool to help us carry out our back-compat policy.

I coded up an example with StandardAnalyzer:

  * The ctor now takes a required arg (Version matchVersion).  You
    pass Version.LUCENE_CURRENT to always get lates & greatest, or eg
    Version.LUCENE_24 to match 2.4's bugs/settings/behavior.

  * StandardAalyzer conditionalizes the ""replace invalid acronym"" and
    ""enable position increment in StopFilter"" based on matchVersion.

  * It also prevents creating zillions of ctors, over time, as we need
    to change settings in the class.  EG StandardAnalyzer now has 2
    settings that are version dependent, and there's at least another
    2 issues open on fixing some more of its bugs.

The migration is also very clean: we'd only add this to classes on an
""as needed"" basis.  On the first release that adds the arg, the
default remains back compatible with the prior release.  Then, going
forward, we are free to fix issues on that class and conditionalize by
matchVersion.

The javadoc at the top of StandardAnalyzer clearly calls out what
version specific behavior is done:

{code}
 * <p>You must specify the required {@link Version}
 * compatibility when creating StandardAnalyzer:
 * <ul>
 *   <li> As of 2.9, StopFilter preserves position
 *        increments by default
 *   <li> As of 2.9, Tokens incorrectly idenfied as acronyms
 *        are corrected (see <a href=""https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1068"">LUCENE-1608</a>
 * </ul>

1,"HttpClient does not properly handle 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' encodingAs always I'd like to pass on my thanks, I'm finding HttpClient really useful.

The problem occurs because I use Struts map based ActionForm and these generate 
request parameters of the form:

<input type=""text"" name=""searchSelection(c)"">

When this is submitted using the PostMethod class the generateRequestBody() is 
called and in turn this calls the URI.encode() method with a BitSet of the 
acceptable characters. In this case the '(' and ')' characters are marked as 
acceptable.

The problem is that this does not work correctly when I submit it to my remote 
server. If however I issue the request directly (from a webpage rather than 
using HttpClient) it works and when I examine the request input stream I can see 
that the parameter has been re-written so that 'select(c)' is displayed as 
'select%28c%29'.

This may be my error because of encoding problems or the fact I am not setting 
the content type etc. correctly. Or it could be a bug. I'm afraid my HTTP

0,"Allow to control how payloads are mergedLucene handles backwards-compatibility of its data structures by
converting them from the old into the new formats during segment
merging. 

Payloads are simply byte arrays in which users can store arbitrary
data. Applications that use payloads might want to convert the format
of their payloads in a similar fashion. Otherwise it's not easily
possible to ever change the encoding of a payload without reindexing.

So I propose to introduce a PayloadMerger class that the SegmentMerger
invokes to merge the payloads from multiple segments. Users can then
implement their own PayloadMerger to convert payloads from an old into
a new format.

In the future we need this kind of flexibility also for column-stride
fields (LUCENE-1231) and flexible indexing codecs.

In addition to that it would be nice if users could store version
information in the segments file. E.g. they could store ""in segment _2
the term a:b uses payloads of format x.y"".

0,"Connection is not released back to the pool if a runtime exception is thrown in HttpMethod#releaseConnection methodthe default config of leaving the HttpClientParams.CONNECTION_MANAGER_TIMEOUT as zero means 
that the first time the connection manager fails to immediately get a connection you application hangs. 
(at least using MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager.)

this is because the zero gets passed onto a call to Object.wait(long timeout) and, from the docs, ""If 
timeout is zero, however, then real time is not taken into consideration and the thread simply waits 
until notified."". 

since nothing ever ""notify()""s the thread everything just stops...

the default behaviour of the client more should be more predictable. you don't expect it to hang your 
entire app if it can't get a connection, you expect it to timeout then throw an exception or give some 
other kind of feedback.

it would make sense to give a default of, say, arbitrarily, 10 seconds or so. this would save every single 
user of the classes having to dig around in the code/documentation and explictly set this param. they 
might decide that the default value isn't right and hence change it, but that's tweaking behaviour, not 
correcting it. i certainly thought it was a bug in the code (yours or mine), not my config and have been 
fretting around it for a while.

0,"Send all variants' ETags on ""variant miss""From section 13.6 of RFC 2616:

If an entity tag was assigned to a cached representation, the forwarded request SHOULD be conditional and include the entity tags in an If-None-Match header field from all its cache entries for the resource. This conveys to the server the set of entities currently held by the cache, so that if any one of these entities matches the requested entity, the server can use the ETag header field in its 304 (Not Modified) response to tell the cache which entry is appropriate. If the entity-tag of the new response matches that of an existing entry, the new response SHOULD be used to update the header fields of the existing entry, and the result MUST be returned to the client.

Presently, we simply forward the request to the request without the conditionals.  This improvement would consist of adding the conditionals to the request, and properly handling the response.  An example of such would be the following:

 - request resource with ""Accept-Encoding: gzip"", response has ""Etag: etag1"", ""Vary: Accept-Encoding""
 - request resource with ""Accept-Encoding: deflate"", request is forwarded with ""If-None-Match: etag1"" added, response is 200, with ""ETag: etag2""
 - request resource with ""Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate"", request is forwarded with ""If-None-Match: etag1, etag2"" added, response is 304, with ""ETag: etag1"" indicating we should use the first response for this request"

0,"Make CMS smarter about thread prioritiesSpinoff from LUCENE-2161...

The hard throttling CMS does (blocking the incoming thread that wants
to launch a new merge) can be devastating when it strikes during NRT
reopen.

It can easily happen if a huge merge is off and running, but then a
tiny merge is needed to clean up recently created segments due to
frequent reopens.

I think a small change to CMS, whereby it assigns a higher thread
priority to tiny merges than big merges, should allow us to increase
the max merge thread count again, and greatly reduce the chance that
NRT's reopen would hit this.

0,"FieldComparator.TermOrdValComparator compares by value unnecessarilyDigging on LUCENE-2504, I noticed that TermOrdValComparator's compareBottom method falls back on compare-by-value when it needn't.

Specifically, if we know the current bottom ord ""matches"" the current segment, we can skip the value comparison when the ords are the same (ie, return 0) because the ords are exactly comparable.

0,"Visibility of Scorer.score(Collector, int, int) is wrongThe method for scoring subsets in Scorer has wrong visibility, its marked protected, but protected methods should not be called from other classes. Protected methods are intended for methods that should be overridden by subclasses and are called by (often) final methods of the same class. They should never be called from foreign classes.

This method is called from another class out-of-scope: BooleanScorer(2) - so it must be public, but it's protected. This does not lead to a compiler error because BS(2) is in same package, but may lead to problems if subclasses from other packages override it. When implementing LUCENE-2838 I hit a trap, as I thought tis method should only be called from the class or Scorer itsself, but in fact its called from outside, leading to bugs, because I had not overridden it. As ConstantScorer did not use it I have overridden it with throw UOE and suddenly BooleanQuery was broken, which made it clear that it's called from outside (which is not the intention of protected methods).

We cannot fix this in 3.x, as it would break backwards for classes that overwrite this method, but we can fix visibility in trunk.

1,"[PATCH] MultiSearcher problems with Similarity.docFreq()When MultiSearcher invokes its subsearchers, it is the subsearchers' docFreq()
that is accessed by Similarity.docFreq().  This causes idf's to be computed
local to each index rather than globally, which causes ranking across multiple
indices to not be equivalent to ranking across the entire global collection.

The attached files (if I can figure out how to attach them) provide a potential
partial solution for this.  They properly fix a simple test case, RankingTest,
that was provided by Daniel Naber.

The changes are:
  1.  Searcher:  Add topmostSearcher() field with getter and setter to record
the outermost Searcher.  Default to this.
  2.  MultiSearcher:  Pass down the topmostSearcher when creating the subsearchers.
  3.  IndexSearcher:  Call Query.weight() everywhere with the topmostSearcher
instead of this.
  4.  Query:  Provide a default implementation of Query.combine() so that
MultiSearcher works with all queries.

Problems or possible problems I see:
  1.  This does not address the same issue with RemoteSearchable. 
RemoteSearchable is not a Searcher, nor can it be due to lack of multiple
inheritance in Java, but Query.weight() requires a Searcher.  Perhaps
Query.weight() should be changed to take a Searchable, but this requires
changing many places and I suspect would break apps.
  2.  There may be other places that topmostSearcher should be used instead of this.
  3.  The default implementation for Query.combine() is a guess on my part - it
works for TermQuery.  It's fragile in that the default implementation will hide
bugs caused by queries that inadvertently omit a more precise Query.combine()
method.
  4.  The prior comment on Query.combine() indicates that whoever wrote it was
fully aware of this problem and so probably had another usage in mind, so the
whole issue may just be Daniel's usage in the test case.  It's not apparent to
me, so I probably don't understand something."

0,"TaxonomyReader/Writer and their Lucene* implementationThe facet module contains two interfaces TaxonomyWriter and TaxonomyReader, with two implementations Lucene*. We've never actually implemented two TaxonomyWriters/Readers, so I'm not sure if these interfaces are useful anymore. Therefore I'd like to propose that we do either of the following:

# Remove the interfaces and remove the Lucene part from the implementation classes (to end up with TW/TR impls). Or,
# Keep the interfaces, but rename the Lucene* impls to Directory*.

Whatever we do, I'd like to make the impls/interfaces impl also TwoPhaseCommit.

Any preferences?"
0,"speed up automaton seeking in nextStringWhile testing, i found there are some queries (e.g. wildcard ?????????) that do quite a lot of backtracking.

nextString doesn't handle this particularly well, when it walks the DFA, if it hits a dead-end and needs to backtrack, it increments the bytes, and starts over completely.

alternatively it could save the path information in an int[], and backtrack() could return a position to restart from, instead of just a boolean.

1,"OpenBitSet#hashCode() may return false for identical sets.OpenBitSet uses an internal buffer of long variables to store set bits and an additional 'wlen' index that points 
to the highest used component inside {@link #bits} buffer.

Unlike in JDK, the wlen field is not continuously maintained (on clearing bits, for example). This leads to a situation when wlen may point
far beyond the last set bit. 

The hashCode implementation iterates over all long components of the bits buffer, rotating the hash even for empty components. This is against the contract of hashCode-equals. The following test case illustrates this:

{code}
// initialize two bitsets with different capacity (bits length).
BitSet bs1 = new BitSet(200);
BitSet bs2 = new BitSet(64);
// set the same bit.
bs1.set(3);
bs2.set(3);
        
// equals returns true (passes).
assertEquals(bs1, bs2);
// hashCode returns false (against contract).
assertEquals(bs1.hashCode(), bs2.hashCode());
{code}

Fix and test case attached."

The prepare/commit ones have variants that take a (Map<String,String> commitData) following the ones we have in IndexWriter.

In addition, a TwoPhaseCommitTool which implements a 2-phase commit amongst several TPCs.

Having IndexWriter implement that interface will allow running the 2-phase commit algorithm on multiple IWs or IW + any other object that implements the interface.

We should mark the interface @lucene.internal so as to not block ourselves in the future. This is pretty advanced stuff anyway.

1,"Query with document order fails when result set size > caching hierarchy manager sizeWhen a query returns a lot of nodes in the query result and document order is enabled (which is the default) then the query will fail with error messages in the log:

*ERROR* [main] DocOrderNodeIteratorImpl: Internal error: unable to determine document order of nodes: (DocOrderNodeIteratorImpl.java, line 241)

*ERROR* [main] DocOrderNodeIteratorImpl:    Node2: /stuff/node[2]/node[13]/node5 (DocOrderNodeIteratorImpl.java, line 243)

The critical size seems to be equivalent to the cache size of the caching hierarchy manager. Attached are two test cases. The first one simply creates test nodes and the second one executes a query for those nodes. Using the cache size of 10'000 in the CachingHierarchyManager#DEFAULT_UPPER_LIMIT everything works fine, but when this value is set to 1000 (you need to re-compile the class CachingHierarchyManager) the test fails with the mentioned errors."

0,"Decouple indexer from Document/Field implsI think we should define minimal iterator interfaces,
IndexableDocument/Field, that indexer requires to index documents.

Indexer would consume only these bare minimum interfaces, not the
concrete Document/Field/FieldType classes from oal.document package.

Then, the Document/Field/FieldType hierarchy is one concrete impl of
these interfaces. Apps are free to make their own impls as well.
Maybe eventually we make another impl that enforces a global schema,
eg factored out of Solr's impl.

I think this frees design pressure on our Document/Field/FieldType
hierarchy, ie, these classes are free to become concrete
fully-featured ""user-space"" classes with all sorts of friendly sugar
APIs for adding/removing fields, getting/setting values, types, etc.,
but they don't need substantial extensibility/hierarchy. Ie, the
extensibility point shifts to IndexableDocument/Field interface.

I think this means we can collapse the three classes we now have for a
Field (Fieldable/AbstracField/Field) down to a single concrete class
(well, except for LUCENE-2308 where we want to break out dedicated
classes for different field types...).

1,"HttpClient should always override the host of HostConfiguration if an absolute request URI is givenThis bug most likely occurs on all patforms and OS's, but I have only tested it
on WinXP.

The HttpClient.executeMethod(HostConfiguration,HttpMethod,HttpState) will
receive and throw an IllegalArgumentException stating that ""host parameter is
null"" when a  HostConfiguration object is passed in that ONLY has a proxy set
(via HostConfiguration.setProxy(String, int)). Details to reproduce follow--the
bug can be easily reproduced by using the Apache Axis 1.2 CommonsHTTPSender
class (with JVM system props http.proxyHost, http.proxyPort set):

There is a bug in the Apache Commons HTTP Client 3.0rc2 that does not set the
hostname property
in the <code>HostConfiguration</code> object if the following two steps
are performed:<br>
1. You call
<code>HttpClient.executeMethod(HostConfiguration,HttpMethod,HttpState)</code>
with a <code>HostConfiguration</code> object and an <code>HttpMethod</code> object
(created using the HttpMethod(String uri) constructor).This method 
is called in this exact way in the Apache Axis 1.2 client
(CommonsHTTPSender.java lines 132 and 186).<br>
2. That <code>HostConfiguration</code> object only has a proxy set (using
setProxy(String, int)). This method 
is called in this exact way in the Apache Axis 1.2 client
(CommonsHTTPSender.java line 389).<br>

Apache Axis 1.2rc3 CommonsHTTPSender.java did not expose this bug in Commons
HTTP Client 3.0rc2 because
it set the <code>HostConfiguration</code> in a different manner, as follows:<br>
1. Call <code>HttpClient.setHostConfiguration(HostConfiguration)</code> first.
Again,
The <code>HostConfiguration</code> object must only have a proxy set and no host
name.<br>
2. Then call <code>HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpMethod)</code>.<br>

Using the above steps (as in Axis 1.2rc3 CommonsHTTPSender.java, invoke()
method), line 379 in HttpClient.java evaluates to true
because the argument <code>hostConfiguration</code> is null (see line 324 in
HttpClient.java) and the local 
variable <code>defaultHostConfiguration</code> ==
<code>HttpClient.setHostConfiguration(HostConfiguration)</code>
which was set in item #1 above. The hostname then gets set in the
<code>HostConfiguration</code>
object in line 384 of HttpClient.java."

1,"""Socket Closed"" IOException thrown by HttpConnectionHttpClient.java was modified in version 2.0 Final in method executeMethod().
The call to connection.setSoTimeout() used to be in RC3 after the call to
connection.isOpen(), but in the final version the call happens before the call 
to isOpen(). The result of the change is that the setSoTimeout() call could 
throw IOException because of closed socket.

I would fix the problem by adding to HttpConnection.setSoTimeout() (and to 
other similar methods in HttpConnection) an explicit check (a call to isOpen
()) whether the socket is closed as the existence of socket object does not 
guarantee it. I.e the following code:

    public void setSoTimeout(int timeout)
        throws SocketException, IllegalStateException {
        LOG.debug(""HttpConnection.setSoTimeout("" + timeout + "")"");
        soTimeout = timeout;
        if (socket != null) {
            socket.setSoTimeout(timeout);
        }
    }

would be changed to

    public void setSoTimeout(int timeout)
        throws SocketException, IllegalStateException {
        LOG.debug(""HttpConnection.setSoTimeout("" + timeout + "")"");
        soTimeout = timeout;

Hi all,
I am trying to authenticate to a server via a proxy which also requires
authentication. It seems that I can get either the proxy authentication to work
OR the site authentication to work, but not both.

Both seem to work independently when I set the credentials (or proxy
credentials) using NTCredentials (e.g. if I connect to the site from a network
not using a proxy I can get it to work, and I can authenticate to the proxy only
to get a 401 authentication failed from the server when using the proxy).

I read in the Authentication tutorial that you can't authenticate using NTLM to
both the proxy and site, so I'm trying various combinations of authentication,
but I can't find any documentation that specifically covers this case and I feel
like I'm just taking stabs in the dark right now.

If anyone can point me in the direction of the light at the end of the tunnel
I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,
David

David,

You _really_ can't use NTLM to authenticate with the proxy and the
target host at the same, due to the nature of this authentication
scheme. Really. That was not a joke.

Please consider using one of the following combinations instead:

(1) BASIC proxy + NTLM host if both the clent and the proxy are within a
trusted network segment

(2) NTLM proxy + SSL + BASIC host

Both combinations should provide an adequate (or better in the latter case)
security

Hope this helps

-------------------

Thanks for the reply Oleg. This is what I figured, but I cannot see how to use
different authentication schemes for the Proxy vs. the Site authentication
challenge.

I tried adding the code suggested in the Authentication tutorial:

        List authPrefs = new ArrayList(2);
        authPrefs.add(AuthPolicy.DIGEST);
        authPrefs.add(AuthPolicy.BASIC);
        authPrefs.add(AuthPolicy.NTLM);
         This will exclude the NTLM authentication scheme
        httpclient.getParams().setParameter(AuthPolicy.AUTH_SCHEME_PRIORITY,
authPrefs);

I got a message stating that it was attempting BASIC authentication for the
Proxy and that it failed (probably because the domain doesn't get passed I
guess). So my thought is that I need NTLM for the proxy authentication and Basic
will work for the site authentication.

The question I am then working on is how to direct the HttpClient to select that
order of authentication methods. If I let it take NTLM as the preffered
authentication method then it will try to authenticate both challenges with NTLM.

I sure there is just some little detail I'm missing here somewhere, it's just
hard to find it.

Thanks a lot!
David

--------------

Hi Oleg, thanks, I'll put that request in today.
This helps a lot, at least I know I'm on the right path now.

I am attempting to devise a workaround for this by handling the authentication
manually (setDoAuthentication(false)).

When I see a 401 error I am processing a basic authentication with the site
credentials, when I see a 407 error I want to process an NTLM authentication
with the proxy credentials.

To that end I have the following code that runs after
httpclient.execute(getmethod) executes. The code below works perfectly for the
basic authentication (when the proxy is not in the picture).

In looking up the Handshake of the NTLM authentication I see that I have a
problem with the code below since the handshake includes 2 challenge and
authorization steps before the authentication succeeds. I'm not clear how I
could manually authenticate the NTLM response. I would expect the NTLMScheme
class to contain a Type 1 and Type 3 authenticate() method for processing both
challenge responses. Is there another way of processing the NTLM authentication
after receiving the initial authentication challenge from the server?

        //Check for Proxy or Site authentication
        if(getmethod.getStatusCode() == 401){
            //Authenticate to the site using Basic authentication.
            BasicScheme basicscheme = new BasicScheme();
            String basic_auth_string = basicscheme.authenticate(new
NTCredentials(""cwftp"", ""664A754c"", """", """"), getmethod);
            Header basic_auth_header = new Header(""Authorization"",
basic_auth_string);
            getmethod.addRequestHeader(basic_auth_header);
            try{
                httpclient.executeMethod(getmethod);
            }catch(Exception e){

0,"Performance improvement: Lazy skipping on proximity fileHello,

I'm proposing a patch here that changes org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentTermPositions to avoid unnecessary skips and reads on the proximity stream. Currently a call of next() or seek(), which causes a movement to a document in the freq file also moves the prox pointer to the posting list of that document.  But this is only necessary if actual positions have to be retrieved for that particular document. 

Consider for example a phrase query with two terms: the freq pointer for term 1 has to move to document x to answer the question if the term occurs in that document. But *only* if term 2 also matches document x, the positions have to be read to figure out if term 1 and term 2 appear next to each other in document x and thus satisfy the query. 

A move to the posting list of a document can be quite expensive. It has to be skipped to the last skip point before that document and then the documents between the skip point and the desired document have to be scanned, which means that the VInts of all positions of those documents have to be read and decoded. 

An improvement is to move the prox pointer lazily to a document only if nextPosition() is called. This will become even more important in the future when the size of the proximity file increases (e. g. by adding payloads to the posting lists).

My patch implements this lazy skipping. All unit tests pass. 


I also attach a new unit test that works as follows:
Using a RamDirectory an index is created and test docs are added. Then the index is optimized to make sure it only has a single segment. This is important, because IndexReader.open() returns an instance of SegmentReader if there is only one segment in the index. The proxStream instance of SegmentReader is package protected, so it is possible to set proxStream to a different object. I am using a class called SeeksCountingStream that extends IndexInput in a way that it is able to count the number of invocations of seek(). 

Then the testcase searches the index using a PhraseQuery ""term1 term2"". It is known how many documents match that query and the testcase can verify that seek() on the proxStream is not called more often than number of search hits.

Example:
Number of docs in the index: 500
Number of docs that match the query ""term1 term2"": 5

Invocations of seek on prox stream (old code): 29
Invocations of seek on prox stream (patched version): 5

1,"OCM:The UUID of the collection elements changes on update.On ocm.update transaction, the  Current implementation of DefaultCollectionConverterImpl recreates the colleciton-element nodes if there is no id field specificaiton.  This is completely valid for majority of the cases.  But I came across a case where the colleciton element has a uuid field.  In this case also what is happening with the current implementation is that it drops all the elements from the old collection-elements and recreates the new ones.  The major flip side is that now I am left with brand new UUIDs.  I think we should address the uniqueness characteristics specified through UUID also while mapping colleciton elements.

I have a patch and a TestCase to verify the same.  I have implemented it only for the digester.  If people feel the approach is right I will work out an annotation based testcase as well.  I do not think it is going to fail even with annotations.

0,"[PATCH] LockFactory implementation based on OS native locks (java.nio.*)The current default locking for FSDirectory is SimpleFSLockFactory.
It uses java.io.File.createNewFile for its locking, which has this
spooky warning in Sun's javadocs:

    Note: this method should not be used for file-locking, as the
    resulting protocol cannot be made to work reliably. The FileLock
    facility should be used instead.

So, this patch provides a LockFactory implementation based on FileLock
(using java.nio.*).

All unit tests pass with this patch, on OS X (10.4.8), Linux (Ubuntu
6.06), and Windows XP SP2.

Another benefit of native locks is the OS automatically frees them if
the JVM exits before Lucene can free its locks.  Many people seem to
hit this (old lock files still on disk) now.

I've created this new class:

  org.apache.lucene.store.NativeFSLockFactory

and added a couple test cases to the existing TestLockFactory.

I've left SimpleFSLockFactory as the default locking for FSDirectory
for now.  I think we should get some usage / experience with
NativeFSLockFactory and then later on make it the default locking
implementation?

I also tested changing FSDirectory's default locking to
NativeFSLockFactory and all unit tests still pass (on the above
platforms).

One important note about locking over NFS: some NFS servers and/or
clients do not support it, or, it's a configuration option or mode
that must be explicitly enabled.  When it's misconfigured it's able to
take a long time (35 seconds in my case) before throwing an exception.
To handle this, I acquire & release a random test lock on creating the
NativeFSLockFactory to verify locking is configured properly.

A few other small changes in the patch:

    - Added a ""failure reason"" to Lock.java so that in
      obtain(lockWaitTimeout), if there is a persistent IOException
      in trying to obtain the lock, this can be messaged & included in
      the ""Lock obtain timed out"" that's raised.

    - Corrected javadoc in SimpleFSLockFactory: it previously said the
      wrong system property for overriding lock class via system
      properties

    - Fixed unhandled IOException when opening an IndexWriter for
      create, if the locks dir does not exist (just added
      lockDir.exists() check in clearAllLocks method of
      SimpleFSLockFactory & NativeFSLockFactory.

    - Fixed a few small unrelated issues with TestLockFactory, and
      also fixed tests to accept NativeFSLockFactory as the default
      locking implementation for FSDirectory.

    - Fixed a typo in javadoc in FieldsReader.java

    - Added some more javadoc for the LockFactory.setLockPrefix

0,"TCK vs available property typesThe TCK tests allow configuration of node type / property names to tests specific property types, but they do not take into account that a given repository may not support a specific property type (this is similar to issue JCR-801 about multiple workspace support).

JSR-170 is a bit fuzzy here: it requires all types, but does not require that every type actually exists on a settable node type. In practice, a repository may support reference properties on the builtin nodetypes for version storage, but nowhere else.

Thus, there should be a way to configure the tests so that specific property type tests are left out. Again, there are a few possibilities to do that:

1) reserve a special property name for the case where the test should be skipped (""PROPERTY_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORT""), or

2) add new config flags.

The latter arguably is the cleaner approach, the former avoids introducing new configuration parameters. Thus, I'm leaning to 2). Feedback appreciated.

subclass to override this (e.g. populate with distributed stats).

Its also impossible to then do this with SearcherManager.

One idea is make this a factory method (or similar) on IndexSearcher instead,
so you don't need to subclass it to override.

Then you can initialize this in a SearcherWarmer, except there is currently
a lot of hair in what this warming should be. This is a prime example where
Searcher has different meaning from Reader, we should clean this up.

Otherwise, lets make NRT/SearcherManager subclassable in such a way that 
you can return a custom indexsearcher."
1,"Checking of stale connections is brokenHttpConnections that went stale (dropped by server) throw SocketExceptions
instead of silently re-opening themselves, as has been the case with earlier
versions of HttpClient.

I think the problem for this can be found in HttpConnection:

  public boolean closeIfStale() throws IOException {
    if (used && isOpen && isStale()) {
      LOG.debug(""Connection is stale, closing..."");
      close();
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

staleness is only checked if used = true, but there is no code in HttpConnection
that sets the used flag. In other words: used is always false and isStale() is
never called."
0,"LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket() should have access to HttpParamsWe use a custom implementation of LayeredSchemeSocketFactory that manages a keystore location through HttpParams. That allows us to use different keystores on a per connection basis.

When a proxy is used LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket() is invoked which does not have a parameter that passes the HttpParams along. In consequence certificate authentication fails in our implementation. Is there a reason why all other factory methods in the super class have an HttpParams parameter except for LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket()?

The downstream bug is here:

369805: certificate authentication with custom keystore fails behind proxy
https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=369805

Any input would be greatly appreciated."
1,"HttpClient 4.1 ignores request retry handler and stops retrying when a read timeout is followed by a connection refusalI encountered an issue while writing unit tests for the RestBackup(tm) API Client Library, https://github.com/mleonhard/restbackup-java .  HttpClient 4.1 is failing to retry when it encounters a read timeout followed by a connection refusal.  This problem occurs on Windows but not on Linux.  Below is a short program that reproduces the problem.  It performs the expected 5 request attempts on Linux but only 2 on Windows.

My Windows environment is a laptop with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and Oracle Java SE Development Kit Update 21 32-bit.  My Linux environment is Amazon EC2 with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 32-bit and Oracle Java SE Development Kit Update 21 32-bit.

This is my first bug report to an Apache project.  I'd like to add that I'm a big fan of the Commons libraries and Http Components.

Sincerely,
-Michael

0,"equals and hashCode implementation in org.apache.lucene.search.* packageI would like to talk about the implementation of equals and hashCode method  in org.apache.lucene.search.* package. 

Example One:

org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanTermQuery (Super Class)
	<- org.apache.lucene.search.payloads.BoostingTermQuery (Sub Class)

Observation:

* BoostingTermQuery defines equals but inherits hashCode from SpanTermQuery. Definition of equals is a code clone of SpanTermQuery with a change in class name. 

Intention:

I believe the intention of equals redefinition in BoostingTermQuery is not to make the objects of SpanTermQuery and BoostingTermQuery comparable. ie. spanTermQuery.equals(boostingTermQuery) == false && boostingTermQuery.equals(spanTermQuery) == false.


Problem:

With current implementation, the intention might not be respected as a result of symmetric property violation of equals contract i.e.
spanTermQuery.equals(boostingTermQuery) == true (can be) && boostingTermQuery.equals(spanTermQuery) == false. (always)
(Note: Provided their state variables are equal)

Solution:

Change implementation of equals in SpanTermQuery from:

{code:title=SpanTermQuery.java|borderStyle=solid}
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!(o instanceof SpanTermQuery))
      return false;
    SpanTermQuery other = (SpanTermQuery)o;
    return (this.getBoost() == other.getBoost())
      && this.term.equals(other.term);
  }
{code}

To:
{code:title=SpanTermQuery.java|borderStyle=solid}
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
  	if(o == this) return true;
  	if(o == null || o.getClass() != this.getClass()) return false;
//    if (!(o instanceof SpanTermQuery))
//      return false;
    SpanTermQuery other = (SpanTermQuery)o;
    return (this.getBoost() == other.getBoost())
      && this.term.equals(other.term);
  }
{code}

Advantage:

* BoostingTermQuery.equals and BoostingTermQuery.hashCode is not needed while still preserving the same intention as before.
 
* Any further subclassing that does not add new state variables in the extended classes of SpanTermQuery, does not have to redefine equals and hashCode. 

* Even if a new state variable is added in a subclass, the symmetric property of equals contract will still be respected irrespective of implementation (i.e. instanceof / getClass) of equals and hashCode in the subclasses.


Example Two:


org.apache.lucene.search.CachingWrapperFilter (Super Class)
	<- org.apache.lucene.search.CachingWrapperFilterHelper (Sub Class)

Observation:
Same as Example One.

Problem:
Same as Example one.

Solution:
Change equals in CachingWrapperFilter from:
{code:title=CachingWrapperFilter.java|borderStyle=solid}
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!(o instanceof CachingWrapperFilter)) return false;
    return this.filter.equals(((CachingWrapperFilter)o).filter);
  }
{code}

To:
{code:title=CachingWrapperFilter.java|borderStyle=solid}
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
//    if (!(o instanceof CachingWrapperFilter)) return false;
    if(o == this) return true;
    if(o == null || o.getClass() != this.getClass()) return false;
    return this.filter.equals(((CachingWrapperFilter)o).filter);
  }
{code}

Advantage:
Same as Example One. Here, CachingWrapperFilterHelper.equals and CachingWrapperFilterHelper.hashCode is not needed.


Example Three:

org.apache.lucene.search.MultiTermQuery (Abstract Parent)
	<- org.apache.lucene.search.FuzzyQuery (Concrete Sub)
	<- org.apache.lucene.search.WildcardQuery (Concrete Sub)

Observation (Not a problem):

* WildcardQuery defines equals but inherits hashCode from MultiTermQuery.
Definition of equals contains just super.equals invocation. 

* FuzzyQuery has few state variables added that are referenced in its equals and hashCode.
Intention:

I believe the intention here is not to make objects of FuzzyQuery and WildcardQuery comparable. ie. fuzzyQuery.equals(wildCardQuery) == false && wildCardQuery.equals(fuzzyQuery) == false.

Proposed Implementation:
How about changing the implementation of equals in MultiTermQuery from:

{code:title=MultiTermQuery.java|borderStyle=solid}
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
      if (this == o) return true;
      if (!(o instanceof MultiTermQuery)) return false;

      final MultiTermQuery multiTermQuery = (MultiTermQuery) o;

      if (!term.equals(multiTermQuery.term)) return false;

      return getBoost() == multiTermQuery.getBoost();
    }
{code}

To:
{code:title=MultiTermQuery.java|borderStyle=solid}
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
      if (this == o) return true;
//      if (!(o instanceof MultiTermQuery)) return false;
      if(o == null || o.getClass() != this.getClass()) return false;

      final MultiTermQuery multiTermQuery = (MultiTermQuery) o;

      if (!term.equals(multiTermQuery.term)) return false;

      return getBoost() == multiTermQuery.getBoost();
    }
{code}

Advantage:

Same as above. Here, WildcardQuery.equals is not needed as it does not define any new state. (FuzzyQuery.equals is still needed because FuzzyQuery defines new state.)

0,"Optimize PhraseQueryLooking the scorers for PhraseQuery, I think there are some speedups
we could do:

  * The AND part of the scorer (which advances to the next doc that
    has all the terms), in PhraseScorer.doNext, should do the same
    optimizing as BooleanQuery's ConjunctionScorer, ie sort terms from
    rarest to most frequent.  I don't think it should use a linked
    list/firstToLast() that it does today.

  * We do way too much work now when .score() is not called, because
    we go and find all occurrences of the phrase in the doc, whereas
    we should stop only after finding the first and then go and count
    the rest if .score() is called.

  * For the exact case, I think we can use two int arrays to find the
    matches.  The first array holds the count of how many times a term
    in the phrase ""matched"" a phrase starting at that position.  When
    that count == the number of terms in the phrase, it's a match.
    The 2nd is a ""gen"" array (holds docID when that count was last
    touched), to avoid clearing.  Ie when incrementing the count, if
    the docID != gen, we reset count to 0.  I think this'd be faster
    than the PQ we now use.  Downside of this is if you have immense
    docs (position gets very large) we'd need 2 immense arrays.

It'd be great to do LUCENE-1252 along with this, ie factor
PhraseScorer into two AND'd sub-scorers (LUCENE-1252 is open for
this).  The first one should be ConjunctionScorer, and the 2nd one
checks the positions (ie, either the exact or sloppy scorers).  This

Subsequent calls on this connection, lead that the internal session variable is not anymore informed about the current transaction context. (XAItemStateManager, variables tx and txLog are null), because only the xaResource is informed about the new transaction context. Result is that the complete transaction handling does not work anymore.

0,"contrib intelligent Analyzer for ChineseI wrote a Analyzer for apache lucene for analyzing sentences in Chinese language. it's called ""imdict-chinese-analyzer"", the project on google code is here: http://code.google.com/p/imdict-chinese-analyzer/

In Chinese, ""我是中国人""(I am Chinese), should be tokenized as ""我""(I)   ""是""(am)   ""中国人""(Chinese), not ""我"" ""是中"" ""国人"". So the analyzer must handle each sentence properly, or there will be mis-understandings everywhere in the index constructed by Lucene, and the accuracy of the search engine will be affected seriously!

Although there are two analyzer packages in apache repository which can handle Chinese: ChineseAnalyzer and CJKAnalyzer, they take each character or every two adjoining characters as a single word, this is obviously not true in reality, also this strategy will increase the index size and hurt the performance baddly.

The algorithm of imdict-chinese-analyzer is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM), so it can tokenize chinese sentence in a really intelligent way. Tokenizaion accuracy of this model is above 90% according to the paper ""HHMM-based Chinese Lexical analyzer ICTCLAL"" while other analyzer's is about 60%.

In its init() method an instance of RepositoryImpl() is created, in its destroy() method this instance is stopped (using shutdown()).
From the servlet code, only classes in jackrabbit-core, JCR API and Servlet API are referenced.

Even if servlet's doGet() method never gets called, when the web-application is redeployed, all its classes still hang in memory, which produces a memory leak.

0,"isValid should be invoked after analyze rather than before it so it can validate the output of analyzeThe Synonym map has a protected method String analyze(String word) designed for custom stemming.

However, before analyze is invoked on a word, boolean isValid(String str) is used to validate the word - which causes the program to discard words that maybe useable by the custom analyze method. 

I think that isValid should be invoked after analyze rather than before it so it can validate the output of analyze and allow implemters to decide what is valid for the overridden analyze method. (In fact, if you look at code snippet below, isValid should really go after the empty string check)

0,"improved compound file handlingCurrently CompoundFileReader could use some improvements, i see the following problems
* its CSIndexInput extends bufferedindexinput, which is stupid for directories like mmap.
* it seeks on every readInternal
* its not possible for a directory to override or improve the handling of compound files.

for example: it seems if you were impl'ing this thing from scratch, you would just wrap the II directly (not extend BufferedIndexInput,
and add compound file offset X to seek() calls, and override length(). But of course, then you couldnt throw read past EOF always when you should,
as a user could read into the next file and be left unaware.

however, some directories could handle this better. for example MMapDirectory could return an indexinput that simply mmaps the 'slice' of the CFS file.
its underlying bytebuffer etc naturally does bounds checks already etc, so it wouldnt need to be buffered, not even needing to add any offsets to seek(),
as its position would just work.

So I think we should try to refactor this so that a Directory can customize how compound files are handled, the simplest 
case for the least code change would be to add this to Directory.java:

{code}
  public Directory openCompoundInput(String filename) {
    return new CompoundFileReader(this, filename);
  }
{code}

Because most code depends upon the fact compound files are implemented as a Directory and transparent. at least then a subclass could override...
but the 'recursion' is a little ugly... we could still label it expert+internal+experimental or whatever.

0,"DirectoryIndexReader finalize() holding TermInfosReader longer than necessaryDirectoryIndexReader has a finalize method, which causes the JDK to keep a reference to the object until it can be finalized.  SegmentReader and MultiSegmentReader are subclasses that contain references to, potentially, hundreds of megabytes of cached data in a TermInfosReader.

Some options would be removing finalize() from DirectoryIndexReader (it releases a write lock at the moment) or possibly nulling out references in various close() and doClose() methods throughout the class hierarchy so that the finalizable object doesn't references the Term arrays.

Here are some options:
* select the local at random only run the test with a single local
* set the local via system property -Dtest.locale=en.EN
* run with the default locale only -Dtest.skiplocale=true
* one from the above but only if instrumented with clover (let common tests run all the locale)

0,"FST.BYTE2 should save as fixed 2 byte not as vIntWe currently write BYTE1 as a single byte, but BYTE2/4 as vInt, but I think that's confusing.  Also, for the FST for the new Kuromoji analyzer (LUCENE-3305), writing as 2 bytes instead shrank the FST and ran faster, presumably because more values were >= 16384 than were < 128.

Separately the whole INPUT_TYPE is very confusing... really all it's doing is ""declaring"" the allowed range of the characters of the input alphabet, and then the only thing that uses that is the write/readLabel methods (well and some confusing sugar methods in Builder!).  Not sure how to fix that yet...

It's a simple change but it changes the FST binary format so any users w/ FSTs out there will have to rebuild (FST is marked experimental...).

1,"Merging implemented by codecs must catch aborted mergesThis is a regression (we lost functionality on landing flex).

When you close IW with ""false"" (meaning abort all running merges), IW asks the merge threads to abort.  The threads are supposed to periodically check if they are aborted and throw an exception if so.

But on the cutover to flex, where the codec can override how merging is done (but a default impl is in the base enum classes), we lost this."

1,"Cookie.parse exception when parsing expiry date in single quotesA Netscape-Enterprise/3.6 SP3 server sends a cookie where the parameter expires='Thu, 05-Dec-
2002 12:07:45 GMT'. 
Cookie.parse throws an exception because none of the four built-in formats 
matches - I have tested that the parse code works OK if the single quotes are omitted from the value 
being parsed.

Resolution: If the value of the 'expires' parameter starts and ends with a 
single quote then strip the first and last character before parsing."

1,"getAllLinearVersions does not return the base versionIt appears that for a given linear version history, getAllLinearVersions returns less versions than getAllVersions -- the root version seems to be missing."
1,"WorkspaceImpl.dispose() might cause ClassNotFoundExceptionWenn using Jackrabbit in an environment, where ClassLoaders may get inactivated in the sense, the loading new classes is not possible anymore, shutting down the repository may result in a ClassNotFoundException during WorkspaceImpl.dispose().

Reason for this is, that in the dispose() method, the ObservationManager is asked for all registered event listeners for them to be removed from the ObservationManager one-by-one. Asking for the listeners results in a new EventListenerIteratorImpl object being created.

If now, this class has never been used during the live time of the repository, this would cause a ClassNotFoundException because the class loader is not laoding classes anymore in the specific environment.

The specific environment is Eclipse, where one plugin is managing different Repository instances provided by separate plugins. When now the Jackrabbit provider plugin has already been stopped while the managing plugin tries to shutdown the Jackrabbit repository, the EventListenerIteratorImpl class cannot be loaded anymore and disposing the WorkspaceImpl in a controlled way fails.

I suggest adding an ObservationManagerImpl.dispose() method, which is called by the WorkspaceImpl like :
    WorkspaceImpl.dispose() {
       if (obsMgr != null) {
         obsMgr.dispose();
         obsMgr = null;
        }
    }

As a side effect of not calling getObservationManager[Impl]() the observation manager would also not be created if not existing yet.

As a side effect to having the dispose method is, that the ObservationManagerImpl class could also do other cleanup work in addition to clearing the listener lists."

1,"Cluster revision entries should be retrieved in orderThe selectRevisionStmtSQL (DatabaseJournal#buildSqlStatements) returns a result set which may not be ordered by REVISION_ID. This has the effect that cluster instances that want to synchronize to the latest revision do not update their local revision appropriately since they assume that the revision result set is ordered (see code in AbstractJournal#doSync). This might cause a lot of unnecessary CPU cycles on these machines with degraded performance as a result. Furthermore, it causes functional issues as well as events may be fired multiple times and in the wrong order."

1,"Request/Response race condition when doing multiple requests on the same connection.If one tries to do multiple request over the same socket connection a race

http://archives.apache.org/eyebrowse/BrowseList?listId=128&by=thread&from=316092

Initial post:
Based on the recent URI discussion, and some other points, it strikes me that we
could take a little more credit for the work that has gone into HttpClient.

On the HttpClient home page
(http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/httpclient/index.html) four RFCs are listed.

Given all the discussion about URIs being thrown around, I think it might be
reasonable to add RFC 2396 - for URI compliance.  Then there is RFC 1867, for
multipart/form-data POST requests (I think I got the right number there).  Are
there RFCs corresponding to our ""cookie"" compliance? Any other RFCs we can claim
credit for conforming to?

With the recent ""Protocol"" changes, I think we've made it relatively
straightforward for clients of HttpClient to plug in their own secure sockets
implementations, making it easier to use third party, non-Sun solutions."

0,"Improve reliability of canAddMixinThe current implementation of canAddMixin in JCR2SPI lacks flexibility. It only consults the (SPI) node type registry, checking for (1) whether the mixin exists, and (2) whether it is already present and (3) whether it's consistent with the node's type.

This is fine for stores where any legal mixin can be added anywhere. It doesn't work well for stores that are limited in what they can do; for instance when nt:file nodes can be made mix:versionable, but nt:folder nodes can't.

Proposal: enhance QNodeTypeDefinition with

Note that I had to ignore StaleItemStateException (which is probably justified, due to not locking stuff IIUC) to let the threads run long enough to show the problem.

Running the test a few times showed the same locking pattern several times: some threads are locked at line 87 (session.save(), no transaction) while others are at line 93 (transaction.commit()), in testConcurrentCheckinInTransaction():

    80    public void testConcurrentCheckinInTransaction() throws RepositoryException {
    81      runTask(new Task() {
    82        public void execute(Session session, Node test) throws RepositoryException {
    83          int i = 0;
    84          try {
    85            Node n = test.addNode(""test"");
    86            n.addMixin(mixVersionable);
    87            session.save();
    88            for (i = 0; i < NUM_OPERATIONS / CONCURRENCY; i++) {
    89              final UserTransaction utx = new UserTransactionImpl(test.getSession());
    90              utx.begin();
    91              n.checkout();
    92              n.checkin();
    93              utx.commit();
    94            }
    95            n.checkout();
    96          } catch (Exception e) {
    97            final String threadName = Thread.currentThread().getName();

1,"SpanOrQuery skipTo() doesn't always move forwardsIn SpanOrQuery the skipTo() method is improperly implemented if the target doc is less than or equal to the current doc, since skipTo() may not be called for any of the clauses' spans:

    public boolean skipTo(int target) throws IOException {
          if (queue == null) {
            return initSpanQueue(target);
          }

          while (queue.size() != 0 && top().doc() < target) {
            if (top().skipTo(target)) {
              queue.adjustTop();
            } else {
              queue.pop();
            }
          }
          
        	return queue.size() != 0;
        }

This violates the correct behavior (as described in the Spans interface documentation), that skipTo() should always move forwards, in other words the correct implementation would be:

    public boolean skipTo(int target) throws IOException {
          if (queue == null) {
            return initSpanQueue(target);
          }

          boolean skipCalled = false;
          while (queue.size() != 0 && top().doc() < target) {
            if (top().skipTo(target)) {
              queue.adjustTop();
            } else {
              queue.pop();
            }
            skipCalled = true;
          }
          
          if (skipCalled) {
        	return queue.size() != 0;
          }

1,"Security issue - DigestScheme uses constant nonce count valueThe nonce count value in DigestScheme is static (set to 00000001) and never changes.  (also seen as comment in said file).

This means that it fails against servers that correctly detect man-in-the-middle or replay attacks, leading to additional 401 requests (every second time), or such servers must be configured to turn such checks off (which is either poor security or poor for performance).

I suggest that at minimum, this count is incremented for every call to DigestScheme#createDigest.  It should also be an instance variable instead of a static, as it really relates to the challenge (assuming cases where instances are cached for reuse).  AtomicInteger is a good choice for implementing this counter.

So, in plain english:

- test case listens for events where the associated parent node equals ""testRoot/nodeName1"", but
- it expects a single event where the Event.getPath() returns ""testRoot/nodeName1"".

This is incorrect (IMHO), because the associated parent node for *that* event is ""testRoot"". 

So the correct test would be to check for:

        checkNodeAdded(events, new String[]{nodeName1 + ""/"" + nodeName2});

Making this change of course leads to a test failure reported against the RI.

"
0,"[PATCH] Extension to binary Fields that allows fixed byte bufferThis is a very simple patch that supports storing binary values in the index
more efficiently.  A new Field constructor accepts a length argument, allowing a
fixed byte[] to be reused acrossed multiple calls with arguments of different
sizes.  A companion change to FieldsWriter uses this length when storing and/or
compressing the field.

There is one remaining case in Document.  Intentionally, no direct accessor to
the length of a binary field is provided from Document, only from Field.  This
is because Field's created by FieldReader will never have a specified length and
this is usual case for Field's read from Document.  It seems less confusing for
most users.

I don't believe any upward incompatibility is introduced here (e.g., from the
possibility of getting a larger byte[] than actually holds the value from
Document), since no such byte[] values are possible without this patch anyway.

The compression case is still inefficient (much copying), but it is hard to see
how Lucene can do too much better.  However, the application can do the
compression externally and pass in the reused compression-output buffer as a
binary value (which is what I'm doing).  This represents a substantialy
allocation savings for storing large documents bodies (compressed) into the
Lucene index.

to become corrupt if the NFS client directory cache is stale.

Not all NFS clients will show this.  Very recent versions of Linux's
NFS client do not seem to show the issue, yet, slightly older ones do,
and the latest Mac OS X one does as well.

I've been working with Patrick Kimber, who provided a standalone test
showing the problem (thank you Patrick!).  This came out of this
thread:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/engine?do=post_view_flat;post=50680;page=1;sb=post_latest_reply;so=ASC;mh=25;list=lucene

Note that the first issue in that discussion has been resolved
(LUCENE-948).  This is a new issue.

0,"Optimize copies between IndexInput and OutputWe've created an optimized copy of files from Directory to Directory. We've also optimized copyBytes recently. However, we're missing the opposite side of the copy - from IndexInput to Output. I'd like to mimic the FileChannel API by having copyTo on IndexInput and copyFrom on IndexOutput. That way, both sides can optimize the copy process, depending on the type of the IndexInput/Output that they need to copy to/from.

FSIndexInput/Output can use FileChannel if the two are FS types. RAMInput/OutputStream can copy to/from the buffers directly, w/o going through intermediate ones. Actually, for RAMIn/Out this might be a big win, because it doesn't care about the type of IndexInput/Output given - it just needs to copy to its buffer directly.

If we do this, I think we can consolidate all Dir.copy() impls down to one (in Directory), and rely on the In/Out ones to do the optimized copy. Plus, it will enable someone to do optimized copies between In/Out outside the scope of Directory.

If this somehow turns out to be impossible, or won't make sense, then I'd like to optimize RAMDirectory.copy(Dir, src, dest) to not use an intermediate buffer."

0,"Performance improvement for TermInfosReaderCurrently we have a bottleneck for multi-term queries: the dictionary lookup is being done
twice for each term. The first time in Similarity.idf(), where searcher.docFreq() is called.
The second time when the posting list is opened (TermDocs or TermPositions).

The dictionary lookup is not cheap, that's why a significant performance improvement is
possible here if we avoid the second lookup. An easy way to do this is to add a small LRU 
cache to TermInfosReader. 

I ran some performance experiments with an LRU cache size of 20, and an mid-size index of
500,000 documents from wikipedia. Here are some test results:

50,000 AND queries with 3 terms each:
old:                  152 secs
new (with LRU cache): 112 secs (26% faster)

50,000 OR queries with 3 terms each:
old:                  175 secs
new (with LRU cache): 133 secs (24% faster)

For bigger indexes this patch will probably have less impact, for smaller once more.

I will attach a patch soon."

It is not called when all persistence managers implement IterablePersistenceManager (GarbageCollector.scanPersistenceManagers).

However there is a problem: IterablePersistenceManager.getAllNodeIds() doesn't return Node objects, and it would make little sense to create real node objects (the performance advantage of scanPersistenceManagers would be lost).

Therefore, I propose a workaround: the ScanEventListener is called using a 'PseudoNode'. This is a class that implements Node but only has meaningful getUUID() and toString() methods. This allows to create a meaningful progress bar (as the UUIDs are returned in order)."

Currently, we have a special SpanRegexQuery in contrib, and issues like LUCENE-522 open for SpanFuzzyQuery.
The SpanRegexQuery in contrib is a little messy additionally.

For any arbitrary MultiTermQueries to work as a SpanQuery, there are only 3 requirements:
# The un-rewritten query must extend SpanQuery so it can be included in Span clauses
# The rewritten query should be SpanOrQuery instead of BooleanQuery
# The rewritten term clauses should be SpanTermQueries.

Instead of having logic like this for each query, i suggest adding two rewrite methods:
* ScoringSpanBoolean rewrite
* TopTermsSpanBoolean rewrite

as a start i wrote these up, and added a SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper that can be used to wrap any multitermquery this way.
there are a few kinks, but I think the MTQ policeman can probably help get through them.

Tracing through the code in CachingWrapperFilter, I can see that this NPE would occur if getDocIdSet() were to return null.

The Javadoc on Filter says that null will be returned if no documents will be accepted by the filter, but it doesn't seem that Lucene itself is handling null return values correctly, so which is correct?  The code or the Javadoc?  Supposing that null really is OK, does this cause any problems with how CachingWrapperFilter is implementing the caching?  I notice it's calling get() and then comparing against null so it wouldn't appear that it can distinguish ""the entry isn't in the cache"" from ""the entry is in the cache but it's null""."

0,"Explicit management of public APII'd like to start using the Clirr Maven plugin [1] to make sure that we don't accidentally break backwards compatibility in our public APIs, most notably in jackrabbit-api and jackrabbit-jcr-commons.

Also, we should start explicitly managing the API versions exposed as a part of the OSGi package metadata. Currently all our public packages simply get the latest project version as their version number, but it would be better if the version was explicitly managed and only updated if the API actually changes. To do this I propose we use @Version annotations from the bnd tool on the package-info.java files in all packages considered a part of our public API.

The Clirr plugin should flag all changes made in the API, so we have an easy way to tell which packages need to have their version numbers updated.

1,"WeightedSpanTermExtractor incorrectly treats the same terms occurring in different query typesGiven a BooleanQuery with multiple clauses, if a term occurs both in a Span / Phrase query, and in a TermQuery, the results of term extraction are unpredictable and depend on the order of clauses. Concequently, the result of highlighting are incorrect.

Example query: t2 t3 ""t1 t2""
Current highlighting: [t1 t2] [t3] t4 t2

The problem comes from the fact that we keep a Map<termText, WeightedSpanTerm>, and if the same term occurs in a Phrase or Span query the resulting WeightedSpanTerm will have a positionSensitive=true, whereas terms added from TermQuery have positionSensitive=false. The end result for this particular term will depend on the order in which the clauses are processed.

My fix is to use a subclass of Map, which on put() always sets the result to the most lax setting, i.e. if we already have a term with positionSensitive=true, and we try to put() a term with positionSensitive=false, we set the result positionSensitive=false, as it will match both cases."

1,"When reopen returns a new IndexReader, both IndexReaders may now control the lifecycle of the underlying Directory which is managed by reference countingRough summary. Basically, FSDirectory tracks references to FSDirectory and when IndexReader.reopen shares a Directory with a created IndexReader and closeDirectory is true, FSDirectory's ref management will see two decrements for one increment. You can end up getting an AlreadyClosed exception on the Directory when the IndexReader is open.

I have a test I'll put up. A solution seems fairly straightforward (at least in what needs to be accomplished)."
0,"Add support to provide custom classloader for class instantiation from configurationThe configuration framework is based around a BaseConfig class, which provides functionality to instantiate a class whose name is configured in the repository configuration file. Examples of such classes are the FileSystem or the PersistenceManager elements.

The current implementation of the BeanConfig.newInstance() method is to use the ""default classloader"" to load configured classes. That is, the class loader of the BeanConfig class is actually used. This is - generally - the class loader which loads the repository. In certain environments, classes may be provided from outside the core repository class loader. An example fo such an environment is an OSGi setup where each bundle gets its own class laoder, which is separate from all other class loaders except declared by configuration.

I propose to enhance the BeanConfig class as follows:

public class BeanConfig {
 ...
 // Current default class loader, default is BeanConfig's class loader
 private static ClassLoader defaultClassLoader =
BeanConfig.class.getClassLoader();
 // Current instance class loader
 private ClassLoader classLoader;
 ...
 // Sets the default class loader for new BeanConfig instances
 public static void setDefaultClassLoader(ClassLoader loader);
 // Returns the default class loader for new BeanConfig instances
 public static ClassLoader getClassLoader();
 // Sets the class loader of this BeanConfig instance
 public void setClassLoader(ClassLoader loader);
 // Returns the class loader of this BeanConfig instance
 public ClassLoader getClassLoader();
}

The BeanConfig.newInstance method would then use the following to use the class:

public Object newInstance() throws ConfigurationException {
 Class clazz = Class.forName(getClassName(), true, getClassLoader());
 ...
}


This has also been discussed on the dev list: http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/jackrabbit-dev/200607.mbox/%3cae03024e0607272341l52aff9b2h3957131411790bc9@mail.gmail.com%3e"

1,"Invalid behavior of StandardTokenizerImplThe following code prints the output of StandardAnalyzer:

        Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
        TokenStream ts = analyzer.tokenStream(""content"", new StringReader(""<some text>""));
        Token t;
        while ((t = ts.next()) != null) {
            System.out.println(t);
        }

If you pass ""www.abc.com"", the output is (www.abc.com,0,11,type=<HOST>) (which is correct in my opinion).
However, if you pass ""www.abc.com."" (notice the extra '.' at the end), the output is (wwwabccom,0,12,type=<ACRONYM>).

I think the behavior in the second case is incorrect for several reasons:
1. It recognizes the string incorrectly (no argue on that).
2. It kind of prevents you from putting URLs at the end of a sentence, which is perfectly legal.
3. An ACRONYM, at least to the best of my understanding, is of the form A.B.C. and not ABC.DEF.

I looked at StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex and I think the problem comes from this definition:
// acronyms: U.S.A., I.B.M., etc.
// use a post-filter to remove dots
ACRONYM    =  {ALPHA} ""."" ({ALPHA} ""."")+

Notice how the comment relates to acronym as U.S.A., I.B.M. and not something else. I changed the definition to
ACRONYM    =  {LETTER} ""."" ({LETTER} ""."")+
and it solved the problem.

1,"IndexReader overwrites future commits when you open it on a past commitHit this on trying to build up a test index for perf testing...

IndexReader (and Writer) accept an IndexCommit on open.

This is quite powerful, because, if you use a deletion policy that keeps multiple commits around, you can open a not-current commit, make some changes, write a new commit, all without altering the ""future"" commits.

I use this to first build up a big wikipedia index, including one commit w/ multiple segments, then another commit after optimize(), and then I open an writable IR to perform deletions off of both those commits.  This gives me a single test index that has all four combinations (single vs multi segment; deletions vs no deletions).

But IndexReader has a bug whereby it overwrites the segments_N file.  (IndexWriter works correctly)."

0,"BlockJoinQuery/CollectorI created a single-pass Query + Collector to implement nested docs.
The approach is similar to LUCENE-2454, in that the app must index
documents in ""join order"", as a block (IW.add/updateDocuments), with
the parent doc at the end of the block, except that this impl is one
pass.

Once you join at indexing time, you can take any query that matches
child docs and join it up to the parent docID space, using
BlockJoinQuery.  You then use BlockJoinCollector, which sorts parent
docs by provided Sort, to gather results, grouped by parent; this
collector finds any BlockJoinQuerys (using Scorer.visitScorers) and
retains the child docs corresponding to each collected parent doc.

After searching is done, you retrieve the TopGroups from a provided
BlockJoinQuery.

Like LUCENE-2454, this is less general than the arbitrary joins in
Solr (SOLR-2272) or parent/child from ElasticSearch
(https://github.com/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/issues/553), since you
must do the join at indexing time as a doc block, but it should be
able to handle nested joins as well as joins to multiple tables,
though I don't yet have test cases for these.

I put this in a new Join module (modules/join); I think as we
refactor join impls we should put them here.

I've worked around this issue by keeping a single SpellChecker open

Could we add a close() method to SpellChecker that will close the
IndexSearcher and null the reference to it? And perhaps add some code

that break thread safety of SpellChecker?

The attached patch adds a close method but leaves it to the user to

openFile is actually called twice on starting the alg, if you use any
task deriving from ResetInputsTask, which closes the original fileIS
that the XML parser may be using.

I changed the thread to instead start on-demand the first time next()
is called.  I also removed a redundant resetInputs() call (which was
opening the file more frequently than needed).  Finally, I added logic
in the thread to detect that the input stream was closed (because
LineDocMaker.resetInputs() was called, eg, if we are not running the
doc maker to exhaustion).

merging in the ad-hoc benchmarking code I've been using in LUCENE-843:

  - Fixed thread safety of DirDocMaker's usage of SimpleDateFormat

  - Print the props in sorted order

  - Added new config ""autocommit=true|false"" to CreateIndexTask

  - Added new config ""ram.flush.mb=int"" to AddDocTask

  - Added new configs ""doc.term.vector.positions=true|false"" and
    ""doc.term.vector.offsets=true|false"" to BasicDocMaker

  - Added WriteLineDocTask.java, so you can make an alg that uses this
    to build up a single file containing one document per line in a
    single file.  EG this alg converts the reuters-out tree into a
    single file that has ~1000 bytes per body field, saved to
    work/reuters.1000.txt:

      docs.dir=reuters-out
      doc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.DirDocMaker
      line.file.out=work/reuters.1000.txt
      doc.maker.forever=false
      {WriteLineDoc(1000)}: *

    Each line has tab-separted TITLE, DATE, BODY fields.

  - Created feeds/LineDocMaker.java that creates documents read from
    the file created by WriteLineDocTask.java.  EG this alg indexes
    all documents created above:

      analyzer=org.apache.lucene.analysis.SimpleAnalyzer
      directory=FSDirectory
      doc.add.log.step=500

      docs.file=work/reuters.1000.txt
      doc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.LineDocMaker
      doc.tokenized=true
      doc.maker.forever=false

      ResetSystemErase
      CreateIndex
      {AddDoc}: *
      CloseIndex

      RepSumByPref AddDoc

I'll attach initial patch shortly.

0,"Upgrade to Tika 0.6 and PDFBox 1.0.0Tika version 0.6 uses POI 3.6 that's notably smaller (-10MB!) than previous versions. There are also a number of other improvements in Tika 0.6 since the 0.5 release.

While doing the upgrade we should also force the PDFBox version to 1.0.0 from the 0.8.0-incubating version that Tika 0.6 uses. PDFBox 1.0.0 has some nice performance gains (around 30% faster) to text extraction along with other improvements."
0,"Remove unused (and untested) methods from ReaderUtil that are also veeeeery ineffectiveReaderUtil contains two methods that are nowhere used and not even tested. Additionally those are implemented with useless List->array copying; ineffective docStart calculation for a binary search later instead directly returning the reader while scanning -- and I am not sure if they really work as expected. As ReaderUtil is @lucene.internal we should remove them in 3.x and trunk, alternatively the useless array copy / docStarts handling should be removed and tests added:

0,Add customizable filtering to GQLCurrently GQL is not very flexible because it does not have any hooks that  allows you to modify the query that gets generated from the GQL syntax. As a first step I'd like to introduce a filtering mechanism that can be used to post process the result set and exclude certain rows. This is useful when you cannot express an application constraint in GQL.

0,"Improve how ConcurrentMergeScheduler handles too-many-merges caseCMS now lets you set ""maxMergeThreads"" to control max # simultaneous
merges.

However, when CMS hits that max, it still allows further merges to
run, by running them in the foreground thread.  So if you set this max
to 1, and use 1 thread to add docs, you can get 2 merges running at
once (which I think is broken).

I think, instead, CMS should pause the foreground thread, waiting
until the number of merge threads drops below the limit.  Then, kick
off the backlog merge in a thread and return control back to primary
thread.

1,"jcr2spi: Unprocessed ItemInfos call to RepositoryService#getItemInfosstefan reported the following problem:

- batchread config reads with depths infinity
- invalidate tree by calling Node.refresh(false)

afterwards, there may still be invalidated item states indicating that not all ItemInfos were processed.
consequently, there are additional calls to getItemInfos that should have been covered by the loading of the tree.
the problem occuring is not related to limitation of the item-cache size.

problem analysis:

there is a bug in WorkspaceItemStateFactory#createItemStates.
there is a wrapper built around the ItemInfo-Iterator but later on the ItemInfo-Iterator is used instead of the wrapper, which pre-fetches items from the underlying iterator and process them upon hasNext()/next()."

  * It over-estimates the size of the sparse file, since when

For Query test XPathQueryLevel2Test.java (src\java\org\apache\jackrabbit\test\api\query) in the TCK, method getFullTextStatement() (used by testFullTextSearch()) uses the word ""AND"" in the syntax in its test that is not in the spec (/*[jcrfnContains(""'quick brown' AND -cat"")]...).  Section ""6.6.4.2 contains function"" of v0.16.3, page 100, outlines the EBNF, which does not include the word ""AND"".

At this point, I think it would be best to omit ""AND"" from the TCK method and let it test the implicit AND.

this actually is because we used an non-spec compliant query

0,"Current implementation of fuzzy and wildcard queries inappropriately implemented as Boolean query rewritesThe implementation of MultiTermQuery in terms of BooleanQuery introduces several problems:

1) Collisions with maximum clause limit on boolean queries which throws an exception.  This is most problematic because it is difficult to ascertain in advance how many terms a fuzzy query or wildcard query might involve.

2) The boolean disjunctive scoring is not appropriate for either fuzzy or wildcard queries.  In effect the score is divided by the number of terms in the query which has nothing to do with the relevancy of the results.

0,"Avoid INFINITE RECURSION when Object Model has cycles.The default ObjectConverterImpl is restricted to acyclic graphs in the object model.

Many Java object models are NOT acyclic.   For instance, I am on your Friends list.   Yoar are on my Friends list.     Java encourages such structures.   Almost any large object model in Java will have hidden cycles.

Saving an Object Model that contains cycles using Graffito causes an infinite recursion.

Clearly, it is important to maintain a 1-to-1 correspondence between Nodes and Objects to prevent this.   In the absence of Multiple Parent Nodes, it will be necessary to use REFERENCE or UNDEFINED Items in place of the 2nd (or greater) Node representing a given Object.   My preference si that the default ObjectConverterImpl should support REFERENCE.,    Failing this, use of UNDEFINED also solves this problem and would  acceptable (as default).  Whether or not REFERENCE is used, both insertion and retrieval must provide a reasonable result.   A custom ojbect converter should be available to switch UNDEFINED to REFERENCE, or vice versa.

Also, it is probably best to keep the targeted, well-defined Nodes close to the Root Node.    This implies that the default ObjectConverterImpl should implement a Breadth-First, rather than a Depth-First, traversal of the Object Model on both insertion and retrieval.   Again, if the default is Depth-First, a custom object converter should be available that implements Breadth-First.

Admittedly, support for (2 representations) X (2 traversals) implies a drastic refactoring and/or rewriting of the ObjectConverterImpl class."
0,"Provide query support  for WEAKREFERENCE reverse lookupthe current implementation of Node.getWeakReferences() and getWeakReferences(String) uses a fulltext query in order to find weak references to a particular node.

this requires the PlainTextExtractor to be enabled in the Search config, e.g. :

providing 'native' WEAKREFERNCE reverse lookup in Jackrabbit's QOM implementation would be certainly more efficient.

1,"Cluster sync not always done when calling session.refresh(..)Session.refresh(..) is supposed to synchronize cluster changes, but this doesn't always happen, specially if the syncDelay is low. The reason is a wrong assumption in ClusterNode.sync: The code there to avoid duplicate sync calls doesn't always work as expected. The following algorithm is used:

        int count = syncCount;
        syncLock.acquire();
        if (count == syncCount) {
            journalSync();
            syncCount++;
        }
        syncLock.release();

The problem is that the background thread might be at the line ""syncCount++"" when Session.refresh(..) is called, so that the main thread believes journalSync was already called and thus doesn't call it."

0,"spi2dav Improve performance for large binary propertiesSending large binary properties over spi2dav is slow and requires a lot of heap space in both client and server.
One problematic part is base64 conversion of the property value.

On the contrary, using 'normal' webdav interface (/repository/default/ instead of /server) for uploading a file (through traditional webdav client) it is pretty fast and don't have such impact on heap space.

Some suggestions from the previous discussion:
 - avoid temporary copies of the data, and persist large objects as early as possible. 
 - transfer large objects in blocks from the Jackrabbit SPI client to the server (and back).
 - make usage of the global data store (JCR-926). 
 - straight forward PUT for single-valued properties

Currently I'm using SortField for the creation of FieldComparators, but I ran into an issue.

I'm proposing to make this method public. Currently I do not see any problems changing the visibility to public, I do not know if there are any (and the reason why this method is currently protected)
I think that this is a cleaner solution then the workaround I used and also other developers can benefit from it. I will also attach a patch to this issue based on the code in the trunk (26th of May). place).

1,"always apply position increment gap between valuesI'm doing some fancy stuff with span queries that is very sensitive to term positions.  I discovered that the position increment gap on indexing is only applied between values when there are existing terms indexed for the document.  I suspect this logic wasn't deliberate, it's just how its always been for no particular reason.  I think it should always apply the gap between fields.  Reference DocInverterPerField.java line 82:

if (fieldState.length > 0)
          fieldState.position += docState.analyzer.getPositionIncrementGap(fieldInfo.name);

This is checking fieldState.length.  I think the condition should simply be:  if (i > 0).
I don't think this change will affect anyone at all but it will certainly help me.  Presently, I can either change this line in Lucene, or I can put in a hack so that the first value for the document is some dummy value which is wasteful."
1,"Possible concurrency bug with Workspace.copy() Hi,

Enclosed below is a test case that can be used to reproduce a
concurrency bug. This test case uses two con-current threads to
execute Workspace.copy() to copy a node to same destination. The
parent node has set its allowSameNameSiblings to false. According to
the javadoc of Workspace.copy(String srcAbsPath, String destAbsPath) :
""This method copies the node at srcAbsPath to the new location at
destAbsPath. If successful, the change is persisted immediately, there
is no need to call save."".  ""An ItemExistException is thrown if a
property already exists at destAbsPath or a node already exist there,
and same name siblings are not allowed. ""

However in reality this is not the case.  The test case can end up
with two child nodes with same names. Please note, not every run can
reproduce the problem, but generally I can get the problem within 3 to
10 iterations. I also got an InvalidItemStateException once (only
once).  Can someone kindly help to confirm if this is a bug in
Jackrabbit or maybe I am using JackRabbit in a wrong way? The test
case has been tested on Jackrabbit 1.6 branch
(http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/tags/1.6.0), Windows
Vista, JDK 1.5.0_14.

The test case is also attached for your convenience.

1,"exception during writeRequest leaves the connection un-releasedThe execute method has the following (simplified) flow:

The release in step 4 happens when the input is completely read, which works fine.
If an exception occurs between steps 1 and 2, the connection is also released
properly.
However, if an exception occurs during step 2, the connection is never released
back and the connection manager eventually runs out of connections.

The easiest way to test this is to make a simple subclass of PostMethod that
overrides the writeRequest method:

public class TestConnectionReleaseMethod extends PostMethod

IOException, HttpException

0,"Create new method optimize(int maxNumSegments) in IndexWriterSpinning this out from the discussion in LUCENE-847.

I think having a way to ""slightly optimize"" your index would be useful
for many applications.

The current optimize() call is very expensive for large indices
because it always optimizes fully down to 1 segment.  If we add a new
method which instead is allowed to stop optimizing once it has <=
maxNumSegments segments in the index, this would allow applications to
eg optimize down to say <= 10 segments after doing a bunch of updates.
This should be a nice compromise of gaining good speedups of searching
while not spending the full (and typically very high) cost of
optimizing down to a single segment.

Since LUCENE-847 is now formalizing an API for decoupling merge policy
from IndexWriter, if we want to add this new optimize method we need
to take it into account in LUCENE-847.

* instead of using assertions to test that tokens streams match, it throws an IllegalStateExceptions when they don't, and then logs a bunch of info about the token streams to System.out -- having assertion messages that tell you *exactly* what doens't match would make a lot more sense.
* it builds up a list of files to analyze using patsh thta it evaluates relative to the current working directory -- which means you get different files depending on wether you run the tests fro mthe contrib level, or from the top level build file
* the list of files it looks for include: ""../../*.txt"", ""../../*.html"", ""../../*.xml"" ... so not only do you get different results when you run the tests in the contrib vs at the top level, but different people runing the tests via the top level build file will get different results depending on what types of text, html, and xml files they happen to have two directories above where they checked out lucene.

The problem seems to be in MultiSearcher.createWeight(Query) method. It creates an instance of CachedDfSource but does not set the similarity. As the result CachedDfSource provides DefaultSimilarity to queries that use it.

Potential solution:
Adding the following line:
    cacheSim.setSimilarity(getSimilarity());
after creating an instance of CacheDfSource (line 312) seems to fix the problem. However, I don't understand enough of the inner workings of this class to be absolutely sure that this is the right thing to do.

0,"Replace Maven POM templates with full POMs, and change documentation accordinglyThe current Maven POM templates only contain dependency information, the bare bones necessary for uploading artifacts to the Maven repository.

The full Maven POMs in the attached patch include the information necessary to run a multi-module Maven build, in addition to serving the same purpose as the current POM templates.

Several dependencies are not available through public maven repositories.  A profile in the top-level POM can be activated to install these dependencies from the various {{lib/}} directories into your local repository.  From the top-level directory:

{code}
mvn -N -Pbootstrap install
{code}

Once these non-Maven dependencies have been installed, to run all Lucene/Solr tests via Maven's surefire plugin, and populate your local repository with all artifacts, from the top level directory, run:

{code}
mvn install
{code}

When one Lucene/Solr module depends on another, the dependency is declared on the *artifact(s)* produced by the other module and deposited in your local repository, rather than on the other module's un-jarred compiler output in the {{build/}} directory, so you must run {{mvn install}} on the other module before its changes are visible to the module that depends on it.

To create all the artifacts without running tests:

{code}
mvn -DskipTests install
{code}

I almost always include the {{clean}} phase when I do a build, e.g.:

{code}
mvn -DskipTests clean install

0,"explore using automaton for fuzzyquerywe can optimize fuzzyquery by using AutomatonTermsEnum. The idea is to speed up the core FuzzyQuery in similar fashion to Wildcard and Regex speedups, maintaining all backwards compatibility.

The advantages are:
* we can seek to terms that are useful, instead of brute-forcing the entire terms dict
* we can determine matches faster, as true/false from a DFA is array lookup, don't even need to run levenshtein.

We build Levenshtein DFAs in linear time with respect to the length of the word: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.16.652

To implement support for 'prefix' length, we simply concatenate two DFAs, which doesn't require us to do NFA->DFA conversion, as the prefix portion is a singleton. the concatenation is also constant time with respect to the size of the fuzzy DFA, it only need examine its start state.

with this algorithm, parametric tables are precomputed so that DFAs can be constructed very quickly.
if the required number of edits is too large (we don't have a table for it), we use ""dumb mode"" at first (no seeking, no DFA, just brute force like now).

As the priority queue fills up during enumeration, the similarity score required to be a competitive term increases, so, the enum gets faster and faster as this happens. This is because terms in core FuzzyQuery are sorted by boost value, then by term (in lexicographic order).

For a large term dictionary with a low minimal similarity, you will fill the pq very quickly since you will match many terms. 
This not only provides a mechanism to switch to more efficient DFAs (edit distance of 2 -> edit distance of 1 -> edit distance of 0) during enumeration, but also to switch from ""dumb mode"" to ""smart mode"".

With this design, we can add more DFAs at any time by adding additional tables. The tradeoff is the tables get rather large, so for very high K, we would start to increase the size of Lucene's jar file. The idea is we don't have include large tables for very high K, by using the 'competitive boost' attribute of the priority queue.

For more information, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_automaton"

Rather than using Double-Checked Locking which is known to have issues, this implementation uses a state pattern, where only one thread can move the object from IndexNotRead state to IndexRead, and in doing so alters the objects behavior, i.e. once the index is loaded, the index nolonger needs a synchronized method. 

In my particular test, this uncreased throughput at least 30 times.

0,"Add TrieRangeFilter to contribAccording to the thread in java-dev (http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/67807 and http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/67839), I want to include my fast numerical range query implementation into lucene contrib-queries.

I implemented (based on RangeFilter) another approach for faster
RangeQueries, based on longs stored in index in a special format.

The idea behind this is to store the longs in different precision in index
and partition the query range in such a way, that the outer boundaries are
search using terms from the highest precision, but the center of the search
Range with lower precision. The implementation stores the longs in 8
different precisions (using a class called TrieUtils). It also has support
for Doubles, using the IEEE 754 floating-point ""double format"" bit layout
with some bit mappings to make them binary sortable. The approach is used in
rather big indexes, query times are even on low performance desktop
computers <<100 ms (!) for very big ranges on indexes with 500000 docs.

I called this RangeQuery variant and format ""TrieRangeRange"" query because
the idea looks like the well-known Trie structures (but it is not identical
to real tries, but algorithms are related to it).

0,"multilingual analyzer based on icuThe standard analyzer in lucene is not exactly unicode-friendly with regards to breaking text into words, especially with respect to non-alphabetic scripts.  This is because it is unaware of unicode bounds properties.

I actually couldn't figure out how the Thai analyzer could possibly be working until i looked at the jflex rules and saw that codepoint range for most of the Thai block was added to the alphanum specification. defining the exact codepoint ranges like this for every language could help with the problem but you'd basically be reimplementing the bounds properties already stated in the unicode standard. 

in general it looks like this kind of behavior is bad in lucene for even latin, for instance, the analyzer will break words around accent marks in decomposed form. While most latin letter + accent combinations have composed forms in unicode, some do not. (this is also an issue for asciifoldingfilter i suppose). 

I've got a partially tested standardanalyzer that uses icu Rule-based BreakIterator instead of jflex. Using this method you can define word boundaries according to the unicode bounds properties. After getting it into some good shape i'd be happy to contribute it for contrib but I wonder if theres a better solution so that out of box lucene will be more friendly to non-ASCII text. Unfortunately it seems jflex does not support use of these properties such as [\p{Word_Break = Extend}] so this is probably the major barrier.

The problem seems to lie in OutputContextImpl.java it makes the mistake of potentially trying to parse a Long as an Integer, here: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit-webdav/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/webdav/io/OutputContextImpl.java

in the method setContentLength(long contentLength):

public void setContentLength(long contentLength) {
       int length = Integer.parseInt(contentLength + """");
       if (length >= 0) {
           response.setContentLength(length);
       }
   }

I'm not sure, but a fix might be like this:

public void setContentLength(long contentLength) {
       if(contentLength <= Integer.MAX_VALUE && contentLength >= 0) {
           response.setContentLength((int) contentLength);
       }else if (contentLength >  Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            response.addHeader(""Content-Length"", Long.toString(contentLength));
       }
   }

This would at least set the Content-Length header, and in some preliminary tests does seem to allow downloading the files."

0,"Add ability to open prior commits to IndexReaderIf you use a customized DeletionPolicy, which keeps multiple commits
around (instead of the default which is to only preserve the most
recent commit), it's useful to be able to list all such commits and
then open a reader against one of these commits.

I've added this API to list commits:

  public static Collection IndexReader.listCommits(Directory)

and these two new open methods to IndexReader to open a specific commit:

  public static IndexReader open(IndexCommit)
  public static IndexReader open(IndexCommit, IndexDeletionPolicy)

0,"Remove circular dependency between VersionManagerImpl and VersionItemStateProviderFrom a architectural perspective the VersionManagerImpl (VMgr) is at a higher level as the VersionItemStateProvider (VISP). While the VMgr deals with Items the VISP deals with ItemState object. Nonetheless the VISP has a reference to the VMgr and also calls the method setNodeReferences(), which violates the rule of a strictly layered system. E.g. one negative effect of this was a deadlock as described in JCR-672. It also makes it hard to solve JCR-962.

The attached patch includes the following changes:

- Move method VersionManagerImpl.setNodeReferences() VersionItemStateManager. The method can operate on ItemStates only and does not need to be in VersionManagerImpl. As can be seen in the current method it directly calls the PeristenceManager, which indicates it should be located in a lower layer.
- Promote the class VersionItemStateManager to a top level class
- Change method VersionManagerImpl.createSharedStateManager to return a VersionItemStateManager
- Remove VersionManagerImpl instance variable from VersionItemStateProvider
- In VersionItemStateProvider.setNodeReferences() call VersionItemStateManager.setNodeReferences()
- Instead of using the PersistenceManager in VersionManagerImpl.getItemReferences() use the ItemStateManager. It also seems that locking is not necessary for this method."
0,"Add javadoc notes about ICUCollationKeyFilter's advantages over CollationKeyFiltercontrib/collation's ICUCollationKeyFilter, which uses ICU4J collation, is faster than CollationKeyFilter, the JVM-provided java.text.Collator implementation in the same package.  The javadocs of these classes should be modified to add a note to this effect.

My curiosity was piqued by [Robert Muir's comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1581?focusedCommentId=12720300#action_12720300] on LUCENE-1581, in which he states that ICUCollationKeyFilter is up to 30x faster than CollationKeyFilter.

I timed the operation of these two classes, with Sun JVM versions 1.4.2/32-bit, 1.5.0/32- and 64-bit, and 1.6.0/64-bit, using 90k word lists of 4 languages (taken from the corresponding Debian wordlist packages and truncated to the first 90k words after a fixed random shuffling), using Collators at the default strength, on a Windows Vista 64-bit machine.  I used an analysis pipeline consisting of WhitespaceTokenizer chained to the collation key filter, so to isolate the time taken by the collation key filters, I also timed WhitespaceTokenizer operating alone for each combination.  The rightmost column represents the performance advantage of the ICU4J implemtation (ICU) over the java.text.Collator implementation (JVM), after discounting the WhitespaceTokenizer time (WST): (JVM-ICU) / (ICU-WST). The best times out of 5 runs for each combination, in milliseconds, are as follows:

slot is not from the current reader.

But this is silly, because if the bottom slot is from a different

reader didn't have the bottom value), so when the incoming ord equals

1,"SharedFieldCache can cause a memory leakThe SharedFieldCache has some problems with the way it builds the cache:
 - as key is has the IndexReader
 - as value it has a inner cache (another map) that has as a key a static inner class called 'Key'.

This 'Key' holds a reference to the comparator used for in the queries ran.
Assuming this comparator is of any type that extends from AbstractFieldComparator (I think all of the custom JR comparators), then it keeps a reference to all the InderReader instances in order to be able to load the values as Comparable(s).

So the circle is complete and the SharedFieldCache entries never get GC'ed.

One option would have been to implement a 'purge' method on the cache, similar to the lucene mechanism, and when an InderReader gets closed is could call 'purge'. But that is both ugly AND is doesn't seem to work that well :)

A more radical option is to remove the cache completely. Each instance of SimpleFieldComparator (the only client of this cache) already builds an array of the available values, so the cache would only help other instances of the same type. We'll not analyze this further.

The proposed solution (patch will follow shortly) is to remove the Comparator reference from the Key class. 
It looks like it has no real purpose there, just to impact the 'equals' of the key, which makes no sense in the first place as the lucene query does not use the Comparator info at all.
If anything, using the same field and 2 different Comparators we'll get 2 different cache entries based on the same values from the lucene index.

Feedback is appreciated!

The latest series, found by Grant and discussed [here|http://search.lucidimagination.com/search/document/c32e81783642df47/spatial_rethinking_cartesian_tiers_implementation] shows that we need to re-think the cartesian tier implementation.

Given the need to create a spatial module containing code taken from both lucene and Solr, it makes sense to deprecate the spatial contrib, and start from scratch in the new module.

1,"QueryObjectModel does not generate the corresponding SQL2 Query when dealing with spaces in the pathThis is the original issue:
----------
I tried to get the childnodes of a node names ""/a b"" using the following code
  QueryManager queryManager=session.getWorkspace().getQueryManager();
  QueryObjectModelFactory qomf=queryManager.getQOMFactory();
  Source source1=qomf.selector(NodeType.NT_BASE, ""selector_0"");
  Column[] columns = new Column[]{qomf.column(""selector_0"", null, null)};
  Constraint constraint2 = qomf.childNode(""selector_0"", ""/a b"");
  QueryObjectModel qom = qomf.createQuery(source1, constraint2 , null, columns);

This is not giving any result when the session is acquired through webdav. But when connected using JNDI it is giving the child nodes. 

The sql statement getting created is 
SELECT selector_0.* FROM [nt:base] AS selector_0 WHERE ISCHILDNODE(selector_0, 
[/a b]).

When using webdav If i give this SQL2 query directly along with quotes around 
the path i.e. ['/a b'] then it is working as expected.
----------

this doesn't have anything to do with webdav. the problem is the QueryObjectModel generates an SQL2 query that is not 100% equivalent, it fails to escape paths that have spaces in them.
this way, in the case of davex remoting, the jr client will use the statement generated instead, which is not escaped, and will fail to return the expected nodes. 

This can be seen easily if we do a System.out.println(qom.getStatement())

1,"DefaultRequestDirector converts redirects of PUT/POST to GET for status codes 301, 302, 307The DefaultRequestDirector treats redirect requests created by all redirect status codes (HttpStatus.SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY: , HttpStatus.SC_MOVED_PERMANENTLY, HttpStatus.SC_SEE_OTHER, HttpStatus.SC_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT) the same, converting PUT/POST methods to GET.  The HttpClient Tutorial even documents this as being in accordance with the specification, but I don't believe that's true.

Per the RFC (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html), conversion of PUT/POST to GET is appropriate only for 303 (See Other).  The others do not suggest this behavior.  In fact, the following notes attached to them call it out as incorrect.

301 (Moved Permanently) has this note:

      Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after
      receiving a 301 status code, some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents
      will erroneously change it into a GET request.

And 302 (Found) say this:

      Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
      to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
      existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
      response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
      of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
      been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
      kind of reaction is expected of the client.

The currently implemented behavior is causing problems with interacting with Central Authentication Service protected resources, among other things."

1,"Preemptive auth flags disregarded during ssl tunnel creationUsing a Squid2.4 proxy, the connection is dropped when trying to connect to a 
ssl site. In order for the connection to remain open, preemptive authorization 
is needed for the proxy. The preemptive authorization flags are not propagated 
down to where the ssl tunnel is created in HttpMethodDirectors executeConnect 
method. A new ConnectMethod object is created for the tunnel but the preemptive 
flags set as parameters are not being set on the new ConnectMethod object.

Here is the code that would replicate the problem using a Squid(2.4) proxy :

HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
client.getHostConfiguration().setProxyHost(new ProxyHost(""someproxy"", 3128));
client.getParams().setAuthenticationPreemptive(true);
client.getState().setProxyCredentials(AuthScope.ANY, new 
UsernamePasswordCredentials(""user"", ""password""));
GetMethod httpget = new GetMethod(""https://www.verisign.com/"");
httpget.getProxyAuthState().setPreemptive();
client.executeMethod(httpget);
httpget.releaseConnection();"
1,"TestParser.testSpanTermXML fails with some simshere is why this test sometimes fails (my explanation in the test i wrote):

{noformat}
  /** make sure all sims work with spanOR(termX, termY) where termY does not exist */
  public void testCrazySpans() throws Exception {
    // The problem: ""normal"" lucene queries create scorers, returning null if terms dont exist
    // This means they never score a term that does not exist.
    // however with spans, there is only one scorer for the whole hierarchy:
    // inner queries are not real queries, their boosts are ignored, etc.
{noformat}

Basically, SpanQueries aren't really queries, you just get one scorer. it calls extractTerms on the whole hierarchy and computes weights (e.g. IDF) on
the whole bag of terms, even if they don't exist.

This is fine, we already have tests that sim's won't bug-out in computeStats() here: however they don't expect to actually score documents based on
these terms that don't exist... however this is exactly what happens in Spans because it doesn't use sub-scorers.

It's an intermittant failure that only happens when multiple threads
are calling commit() at once.  With autoComit=true and
ConcurrentMergeScheduler, this can happen more often because each
merge thread calls commit after it's done.

The problem happens when one thread has already begun the commit
process, but another two or more threads then come along wanting to
also commit after further changes have happened.  Those two or more
threads would wait until the currently committing thread finished, and
then they'd wake up and do their commit.  The problem was, after
waking up they would fail to check whether they had been superseded,
ie whether another thread had already committed more up-to-date
changes.

The fix is simple -- after waking up, check again if your commit has
been superseded, and skip your commit if so.

1,"import must not ignore xml prefixed attributesXML import currently ignores attributes that are in the xml namespace.
e.g., DocViewImportHandler's startElement():

                if (atts.getQName(i).startsWith(""xml:"")) {
                    // skipping xml:space, xml:lang, etc.

                    continue;
                }

That is a significant loss of information, since xml:base, xml:lang, and xml:id attributes are critical to the content.  We should register the xml prefix as a reserved namespace (not needing an xmlns declaration) and then treat it like any other attribute.

Here are some useful XML examples:

2. Use the super-project POM as the parent of all Jackrabbit component POMs

3. Move the contents of trunk/jackrabbit/src/site directly to trunk/src/site, and use the super-project to generate the web site

4. Create independent subprojects for the the jackrabbit-api and jackrabbit-commons components, moving the the corresponding parts of the source tree

5. Move the jcr-server subprojects on level up

0,"Move Query.weight() to IndexSearcher as protected methodWe had this issue several times, latest in LUCENE-3207.

The method Query.weight() was left in Query for backwards reasons in Lucene 2.9 when we changed Weight class. This method is only to be called on top-level queries - and this is done by IndexSearcher. This method is just a utility method, that has nothing to do with the query itsself (it just combines the createWeight method and calls the normalization afterwards). 

The problem we have is that any query that wraps other queries (like CustomScore, ConstantScore, Boolean) calls Query.weight() instead of Query.createWeight(), it will do normalization two times, leading to strange bugs.

For 3.3 I will make Query.weight() simply delegate to IndexSearcher's replacement method with a big deprecation warning, so user sees this. In IndexSearcher itsself the method will be protected to only be called by itsself or subclasses of IndexSearcher. Delegation for backwards is no problem, as protected is accessible by classes in same package.

I would suggest the method name to be IndexSearcher.createNormalizedWeight(Query q)"

0,"Default KuromojiAnalyzer to use search modeKuromoji supports an option to segment text in a way more suitable for search,
by preventing long compound nouns as indexing terms.

In general 'how you segment' can be important depending on the application 
(see http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/acl-wmt08-cws.pdf for some studies on this in chinese)

The current algorithm punishes the cost based on some parameters (SEARCH_MODE_PENALTY, SEARCH_MODE_LENGTH, etc)
for long runs of kanji.

Some questions (these can be separate future issues if any useful ideas come out):
* should these parameters continue to be static-final, or configurable?
* should POS also play a role in the algorithm (can/should we refine exactly what we decompound)?
* is the Tokenizer the best place to do this, or should we do it in a tokenfilter? or both?
  with a tokenfilter, one idea would be to also preserve the original indexing term, overlapping it: e.g. ABCD -> AB, CD, ABCD(posInc=0)
  from my understanding this tends to help with noun compounds in other languages, because IDF of the original term boosts 'exact' compound matches.
  but does a tokenfilter provide the segmenter enough 'context' to do this properly?

Either way, I think as a start we should turn on what we have by default: its likely a very easy win.

0,"Signature changes in AttributeSource for better Generics support of AddAttribute/getAttributeThe last update of Attribute API using AttributeImpl as implementation oif Attributes changed the API a little bit. This change leads to the fact, that in Java 1.5 using generics we are no longer able to add Attributes without casting. addAttribute and getAttribute should return the Attribute interface because the implementation of the attribute is not interesting to the caller. By that in 1.5 using generics, one could add a TermAttribute without casting using:
{code}
TermAttribute termAtt = addAttribute(TermAttribute.class);
{code}
The signature to do this is:
{code}
public <T extends Attribute> T addAttribute(Class<T>)
{code}

The attached patch applies the mentioned change to the signature (without generic, only returning Attribute). No other code changes are needed, as current code always casts the result to the requested interface. I also added the 1.5 method signature for all these methods to the javadocs.

0,"check all tests that use FSDirectory.openIn LUCENE-2471 we were discussing the copyBytes issue, and Shai and I had a discussion about how we could prevent such bugs in the future.

One thing that lead to the bug existing in our code for so long, was that it only happened on windows (e.g. never failed in hudson!)
This was because the bug only happened if you were copying from SimpleFSDirectory, and the test used FSDirectory.open

Today the situation is improving: most tests use newDirectory() which is random by default and never use FSDir.open,
it always uses SimpleFS or NIOFS so that the same random seed will reproduce across both windows and unix.

So I think we need to review all uses of FSDirectory.open in our tests, and minimize these.
In general tests should use newDirectory().
If the test comes with say a zip-file and wants to explicitly open stuff from disk, I think it should open the contents with say SimpleFSDir,
and then call newDirectory(Directory) to copy into a new ""random"" implementation for actual testing. This method already exists:

In these tests, we have two indices. Each index contains a set of documents with fields for 'title',  'section' and 'index'. The final aim is to do a keyword search, across both indices, on the title field and be able to exclude documents from certain sections (and their subsections) using a

1,"KeywordTokenizer does not properly set the end offsetKeywordTokenizer sets the Token's term length attribute but appears to omit the end offset. The issue was discovered while using a highlighter with the KeywordAnalyzer. KeywordAnalyzer delegates to KeywordTokenizer propagating the bug. 

Below is a JUnit test (source is also attached) that exercises various analyzers via a Highlighter instance. Every analyzer but the KeywordAnazlyzer successfully wraps the text with the highlight tags, such as ""<b>thetext</b>"". When using KeywordAnalyzer the tags appear before the text, for example: ""<b></b>thetext"". 

Please note NewKeywordAnalyzer and NewKeywordTokenizer classes below. When using NewKeywordAnalyzer the tags are properly placed around the text. The NewKeywordTokenizer overrides the next method of the KeywordTokenizer setting the end offset for the returned Token. NewKeywordAnalyzer utilizes KeywordTokenizer to produce proper token.

Unless there is an objection I will gladly post a patch in the very near future .

1,"Authentication fails with proxied SSL ConnectionsWhen connecting through a proxy, using SSL and authentication HttpClient winds 
up sending a GET request to the proxy after the initial auth required response, 
the proxy then obviously responds with a not implemented response since it 
can't handle a GET request to an SSL URL.  In essence the following is 
happening:

1. HttpClient sends Connect response.
2. Proxy responds 200 Connect OK
3. HttpClient uses SSL connection to send the request to the web server.
4. Web server responds with not authorized and closes the connection.
5. HttpClient opens a new connection to the proxy and issues a GET request for 
the SSL URL.
6. Proxy returns 501 not implemented.

I'll attach a full log to this bug.

This is likely to be hard to fix since the retry is performed in HttpMethodBase 
but the Connect method is executed by HttpClient so a fix for this may be best 
waiting for 2.1.  This looks very similar to HTTPCLIENT-195 except that that bug is 
marked as fixed and this one still doesn't work, this also applies to 
authentication schemes other than NTLM (testing NTLM and basic).

My best evaluation is that the web server returns Connection: close when it 
rejects the authorization attempt and then HttpMethodBase is incapable of 
creating a new SSL connection through the proxy.  The only thing I can think of 
that could be done prior to 2.1 to fix this is to send a Connection: keep-alive 
as well as the Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive we're already sending with the 
original request."

1,"save() might create new transient propertiesIt seems that when a new node is saved through the parent node, new properties might get created, which are not saved. To persist those properties the new node must be saved again.

Example:

(Consider a mixin type ""extVer"" extending the standard type mix:versionable.)

      Node node = parent.addNode(""newNode"", ""nt:base"");
      node.addMixin(""extVer"");
      // ""mix:versionable"" properties do not exist here
      
      // save the new node

      // fix:
      node.save();

If the last node.save() opertation would not be done, a RepositoryException would result if a node.checkIn() would be done immediately after parent.save().

This seems counterintuitive and seems like an error. I wonder whether the properties should not be added upon ""node.addMixin"" ? At least ""parent.save()"" should (or might I say must ?) not only add the properties but also save them."

0,"Jackrabbit utilitiesAttached are two utilities for Jackrabbit:

The first one is a DataStore implementation that uses Amazon S3 for storage.
This is fairly straightforward. It is configured by adding a DataStore
section to the repository.xml file, e.g.:
   <DataStore class=""org.jcrutil.S3DataStore"">
       <param name=""awsAccessKey"" value="""" />
       <param name=""awsSecretKey"" value="""" />
       <param name=""bucketName"" value="""" />
       <param name=""minModifiedDate"" value=""0"" />
       <param name=""minRecordLength"" value=""0"" />
   </DataStore>

The second utility is a JCR based Commons VFS filesystem provider. This
allows you to access a JCR repository (nt:file and nt:folder nodes) using
the Commons VFS API. I've also used this with MINA FTP Server and Dctm VFS
(http://dctmvfs.sourceforge.net/) to provide FTP access to a Jackrabbit
repository.

As discussed on the list, we can create a new class for Oracle 10.2+, make it inherit from DbFileSystem, and override the createSchema(), and table space related methods, which are the ones that need special handling. Furthermore, we could refactor the current OracleFileSystem and break it into two clases, one of them to keep the current behavior and a new one to keep the common code (which we could rename to OracleBaseFileSystem or similar, to maintain compatiblity with code that uses OracleFileSystem for versions previous to 10.2).

However, read/writeVLong fails (trips an assert).

I'd prefer that both vInt/vLong trip an assert if you ever try to write a negative number... it's badly trappy today.  But, unfortunately, we sometimes rely on this... had we had this assert in 'since the beginning' we could have avoided that.

0,"Enable MultiTermQuery's constant score mode to also use BooleanQuery under the hoodWhen MultiTermQuery is used (via one of its subclasses, eg
WildcardQuery, PrefixQuery, FuzzyQuery, etc.), you can ask it to use
""constant score mode"", which pre-builds a filter and then wraps that
filter as a ConstantScoreQuery.

If you don't set that, it instead builds a [potentially massive]
BooleanQuery with one SHOULD clause per term.

There are some limitations of this approach:

  * The scores returned by the BooleanQuery are often quite
    meaningless to the app, so, one should be able to use a
    BooleanQuery yet get constant scores back.  (Though I vaguely
    remember at least one example someone raised where the scores were
    useful...).

  * The resulting BooleanQuery can easily have too many clauses,
    throwing an extremely confusing exception to newish users.

  * It'd be better to have the freedom to pick ""build filter up front""
    vs ""build massive BooleanQuery"", when constant scoring is enabled,
    because they have different performance tradeoffs.

  * In constant score mode, an OpenBitSet is always used, yet for
    sparse bit sets this does not give good performance.

I think we could address these issues by giving BooleanQuery a
constant score mode, then empower MultiTermQuery (when in constant
score mode) to pick & choose whether to use BooleanQuery vs up-front
filter, and finally empower MultiTermQuery to pick the best (sparse vs
dense) bit set impl.

0,"Deprecate and replace SimpleHttpConnection with the SimpleHttpServer based testing frameworkThanks to Christian Kohlschuetter and Odi we now have a very flexible testing
framework, which enables us to emulate pretty much all the aspects of a HTTP
server functionality including non-compliant behavior and various vendor
specific implementation quirks. 

Many, many thanks go to Christian Kohlschuetter for having contributed the
original code. 

I propose SimpleHttpConnection be deprecated and eventually be phased out. I
took the first steps toward this goal by migrating Basic authentication test
cases. I urge all committers and contributors to use SimpleHttpServer for all
the new cases from now on. Ideally in the future we should even be able to get
rid of Tomcat as a dependency for testing.

I also took liberty of tweaking the SimpleHttpServer API a little. I factored
SimpleRequest and SimpleResponse classes out and provided a new interface called
HttpService, which can be used instead of HttpRequestHandler to implement test
cases in a way very similar to writing servlets. 

I'll commit the patch shortly as it does not really touch any _productive_ code.

0,"CookieIdentityComparator and CookiePathComparator could/should implement SerializableCookieIdentityComparator and CookiePathComparator could/should implement Serializable

As Findbugs suggests:

""Comparator doesn't implement Serializable

This class implements the Comparator interface. You should consider whether or not it should also implement the Serializable interface. If a comparator is used to construct an ordered collection such as a TreeMap, then the TreeMap will be serializable only if the comparator is also serializable. As most comparators have little or no state, making them serializable is generally easy and good defensive programming. ""

Neither class has any state, so implementing Serializable would be trivial.

1,"relative URIs with internal double-slashes ('//') misparsedURI.parseUriReference()'s heuristic for interpreting URI parts is thrown off by relative URIs which include an internal '//'. As a result, portions of the supplied relative URI (path) can be lost. 

For example:

URI rel = new URI(""foo//bar//baz"");
rel.toString();
(java.lang.String) //bar//baz

The culprit seems to be line 1961 of URI improperly concluding that two slashes later than the beginning of 'tmp' are still indicative the URI is a 'net_path'. 

A possible quick fix might be to add a '!isStartedFromPath &&' to the beginning of the line 1961 test, making the line:

            if (!isStartedFromPath && at + 2 < length && tmp.charAt(at + 1) == '/') {

... and thus preventing the misguided authority-parsing from happening when earlier analysis already identified the current string as a strictly path-oriented URI.

(It also appears the setting of the is_net_path boolean at the end of this if's block may be wrong; this code is run for hier_path URIs that are not net_paths in the 2396 syntax. For example:

URI uri = new URI(""http://www.example.com/some/page"");

0,"Restructure codec hierarchySpinoff of LUCENE-2621. (Hoping we can do some of the renaming etc here in a rote way to make progress).

Currently Codec.java only represents a portion of the index, but there are other parts of the index 
(stored fields, term vectors, fieldinfos, ...) that we want under codec control. There is also some 
inconsistency about what a Codec is currently, for example Memory and Pulsing are really just 
PostingsFormats, you might just apply them to a specific field. On the other hand, PreFlex actually
is a Codec: it represents the Lucene 3.x index format (just not all parts yet). I imagine we would
like SimpleText to be the same way.

So, I propose restructuring the classes so that we have something like:
* CodecProvider <-- dead, replaced by java ServiceProvider mechanism. All indexes are 'readable' if codecs are in classpath.
* Codec <-- represents the index format (PostingsFormat + FieldsFormat + ...)
* PostingsFormat: this is what Codec controls today, and Codec will return one of these for a field.
* FieldsFormat: Stored Fields + Term Vectors + FieldInfos?

I think for PreFlex, it doesnt make sense to expose its PostingsFormat as a 'public' class, because preflex
can never be per-field so there is no use in allowing you to configure PreFlex for a specific field.
Similarly, I think in the future we should do the same thing for SimpleText. Nobody needs SimpleText for production, it should
just be a Codec where we try to make as much of the index as plain text and simple as possible for debugging/learning/etc.
So we don't need to expose its PostingsFormat. On the other hand, I don't think we need Pulsing or Memory codecs,
because its pretty silly to make your entire index use one of their PostingsFormats. To parallel with analysis:
PostingsFormat is like Tokenizer and Codec is like Analyzer, and we don't need Analyzers to ""show off"" every Tokenizer.

we can also move the baked in PerFieldCodecWrapper out (it would basically be PerFieldPostingsFormat). Privately it would
write the ids to the file like it does today. in the future, all 3.x hairy backwards code would move to PreflexCodec. 
SimpleTextCodec would get a plain text fieldinfos impl, etc."

1,"QueryParser.getFieldQuery(String,String) doesn't set default slop on MultiPhraseQuerythere seems to have been an oversight in calling mph.setSlop(phraseSlop) in QueryParser.getFieldQuery(String,String).  The result being that in some cases, the ""default slop"" value doesnt' get set right (sometimes, ... see below).

when i tried amending TestMultiAnalyzer to demonstrate the problem, I discovered that the grammer aparently always calls getFieldQuery(String,String,int) -- even if no ""~slop"" was specified in the text being parsed, in which case it passes the default as if it were specified.
(just to clarify: i haven't comfirmed this from a detailed reading of the grammer/code, it's just what i've deduced based on observation of the test)

The problem isn't entirely obvious unless you have a subclasses of QueryParser and try to call getFieldQuery(String,String) directly.   

In my case, I had overridden getFieldQuery(String,String) to call super.getFieldQuery(String,String) and wrap the result in a DisjunctionMaxQuery ... I don't care about supporting the ~slop syntax, but i do care about the default slop and i wasn't getting lucky the way QueryParser does, because getFieldQuery(String,String,int) wasn't getting back something it could call setSlop() with the (default) value it got from the javacc generated code.

My description may not make much sense, but hopefull the test patch i'm about to attach will.  The fix is also in the patch, and is fairly trivial.

(disclaimer: i don't have javacc installed, so I tested this patch by manually making the change to both QueryParser.java ... it should only be commited by someone with javacc who can regen the java file and confirm that my jj change doesn't have some weird bug in it)

1,"Redirection of a POST methodI execute a PostMethod to an URL which redirects me to a HTML page. If I set

   required MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction
   with the user if and only if the method used in the second request is
   GET or HEAD. A client SHOULD detect infinite redirection loops, since
   such loops generate network traffic for each redirection.

      maximum of five redirections. Content developers should be aware

0,"Support DateTools in QueryParserThe QueryParser currently uses the deprecated class DateField to create RangeQueries with date values. However, most users probably use DateTools to store date values in their indexes, because this is the recommended way since DateField has been deprecated. In that case RangeQueries with date values produced by the QueryParser won't work with those indexes.

This patch replaces the use of DateField in QueryParser by DateTools. Because DateTools can produce date values with different resolutions, this patch adds the following methods to QueryParser:

  /**
   * Sets the default date resolution used by RangeQueries for fields for which no
   * specific date resolutions has been set. Field specific resolutions can be set
   * with {@link #setDateResolution(String, DateTools.Resolution)}.
   *  
   * @param dateResolution the default date resolution to set
   */
  public void setDateResolution(DateTools.Resolution dateResolution);
  
  /**
   * Sets the date resolution used by RangeQueries for a specific field.
   *  
   * @param field field for which the date resolution is to be set 
   * @param dateResolution date resolution to set
   */
  public void setDateResolution(String fieldName, DateTools.Resolution dateResolution);

(I also added the corresponding getter methods).

Now the user can set a default date resolution used for all fields or, with the second method, field specific date resolutions.
The initial default resolution, which is used if the user does not set a different resolution, is DateTools.Resolution.DAY. 

Please let me know if you think we should use a different resolution as default.

I extended TestQueryParser to test this new feature.

All unit tests pass.

""The probability [of duplicates] also depends on the quality of the random number generator. A cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator must be used to generate the values, otherwise the probability of duplicates may be significantly higher.""

Therefore, I suggest to change VersionFourGenerator to use the SecureRandom implementation in by default."
0,"Cached filter for a single term fieldThese classes implement inexpensive range filtering over a field containing a single term. They do this by building an integer array of term numbers (storing the term->number mapping in a TreeMap) and then implementing a fast integer comparison based DocSetIdIterator.

This code is currently being used to do age range filtering, but could also be used to do other date filtering or in any application where there need to be multiple filters based on the same single term field. I have an untested implementation of single term filtering and have considered but not yet implemented term set filtering (useful for location based searches) as well. 

The code here is fairly rough; it works but lacks javadocs and toString() and hashCode() methods etc. I'm posting it here to discover if there is other interest in this feature; I don't mind fixing it up but would hate to go to the effort if it's not going to make it into Lucene.

0,"[PATCH] FSDirectory create() method deletes all fileshi all,

the current implementation of FSDirectory.create(...) silently deletes all files
(even empty directories) within the index directory when setting up a new index
with create option enabled. Lucene doesn't care when deleting files in the index
directory if they  belong to lucene or not. I don't think that this is a real
bug, but it can be a pain if somebody whants to store some private information
in the lucene index directory, e.g some configuration files.

Therefore i implemented a FileFilter which knows about the internal lucene file
extensions, so that all other files would never get touched when creating a new
index. The current patch is an enhancement in FSDirectory only. I don't think
that there is a need to make it available in the Directory class and change all
it's depending classes.

0,"Stored-only fields automatically enable norms and tf when added to documentDuring updating my internal components to the new TrieAPI, I have seen the following:

I index a lot of numeric fields with trie encoding omitting norms and term frequency. This works great. Luke shows that both is omitted.

As I sometimes also want to have the components of the field stored and want to use the same field name for it. So I add additionally the field again to the document, but stored only (as the Field c'tor using a TokenStream cannot additionally store the field). As it is stored only, I thought, that I can left out explicit setting of omitNorms and omitTermFreqAndPositions. After adding the stored-only-without-omits field, Luke shows all fields with norms enabled. I am not sure, if the norms/tf were really added to the index, but Luke shows a value for the norms and FieldInfo has it enabled.

In my opinion, this is not intuitive, o.a.l.document.Field  should switch both omit* options on when storing fields only (and also disable other indexing-only options). Alternatively the internal FieldInfo.update(boolean isIndexed, boolean storeTermVector, boolean storePositionWithTermVector, boolean storeOffsetWithTermVector, boolean omitNorms, boolean storePayloads, boolean omitTermFreqAndPositions) should only change the omit* and other options, if the isIndexed parameter (not this.isIndexed) is also true, elsewhere leave it as it is.

In principle, when adding a stored-only field, any indexing-specific options should not be changed in FieldInfo. If the field was indexed with norms before, norms should stay enabled (but this would be the default as it is)."
1,"Cluster Node ID should be trimmedIf the cluster node ID is not configured in repository.xml, it is read from the file cluster_node.id instead. In case this file is edited by hand, some editors (e.g. vi) insert a trailing newline character (""\n""). This leads to the cluster node ID to contain a blank character. While I don't expect this to cause any issues, it is inconvenient for debugging and also introduces line-breaks in log files. I suggest to trim the cluster node ID, so only non-blank characters are used."

0,"Move text extraction into a background threadEven though text extraction is not done right on save() most of the extraction work is later done by a client thread. There is a mechanism in place that commits the deferred work in a background thread. But the background thread is only triggered by a timer and does not constantly write back pending index changes. For regular index changes this is done on purpose and should not be changed. However text extraction work should be moved completely into a background thread because it often takes a fair amount of time to index a large document.

Outline of a possible solution:
- all text filtering is tasks are put into a work queue
- the work queue is processed by a background thread
- basic indexing of nt:resource without text filtering takes place
- the background thread updates the index when text filtering completed for a nt:resource

There should be a configuration parameter that allows to execute text filtering without the background thread. This way it is possible to get the existing behaviour of Jackrabbit: the fulltext index is always up-to-date and can be used.
With the background process this is no longer the case."

This causes some problems as the first notifications triggers the regeneration of the full virtual node type tree, and later notification calls will fail (logging an error) in VirtualNodeTypeStateManager because the removed type is no longer there.

0,"Simplified Repository URI format for JNDI lookupsThe JndiRepositoryFactory class (together with JcrUtils) currently supports the following repository URI formats:

The first uri formats allows no extra JNDI environment settings to be passed in, and the second one is pretty verbose and simply ignores the authority and path parts of the URI.

I'd like to add support for the following simplified format that makes it easy to provide the repository name along with the initial context factory from which the name is to be looked up:

    JcrUtils.getRepository(""jndi://initial-context-factory/name-of-repository"");

Extra JNDI environment settings could still be included as additional query parameters. Backwards compatibility with the previous formats would be guaranteed based on the presence or absence of the org.apache.jackrabbit.repository.jndi.name parameter in hierarchical URIs."

1,"DocumentsWriter blocks flushes when applyDeletes takes forever - memory not releasedIn DocumentsWriter we have a safety check that applies all deletes if the deletes consume too much RAM to prevent too-frequent flushing of a long tail of tiny segments. If we enter applyAllDeletes we essentially lock on IW -> BufferedDeletes which is fine since this usually doesn't take long and doesn't keep DWPTs from indexing. Yet, if that takes long and at the same time a semgent is flushed and subsequently published to the IW we take the lock on the ticket queue and the IW. Now this prevents all other threads to append to the ticketQueue which is done BEFORE we actually flush the segment concurrently and free up the RAM.

Essentially its ok to block on the IW lock but we should not keep concurrent flushed from execution just because we apply deletes. The threads will block once they try to execute maybeMerge after the segment is flushed so we don't pile up subsequent memory but we should actually allow the DWPT to be flushed since we actually try to get rid of memory.

I ran into this by accident due to a coding bug using delete queries instead of terms for each document. This thread dump show the problem:

Binary compatibility can be maintained by doing an instanceof check at the location where AuthScheme.authenticate() is called at the moment, and calling the context aware version if available.

This interface is necessary for the NegotiateScheme authentication scheme because the service names for the authentication tickets are based on the hostname of the target host or proxy host, depending on whether it's normal or proxy authentication, and this information is only available from the HttpContext.

Without the HttpContext there is a workaround that works most of the time, which looks like this:

	String host;
	if (isProxy()) {
		// FIXME this should actually taken from the HttpContext.
		HttpHost proxy = ConnRouteParams.getDefaultProxy(request.getParams());
		host = proxy.getHostName();

0,"Things to be done now that Filter is independent from BitSet(Aside: where is the documentation on how to mark up text in jira comments?)

The following things are left over after LUCENE-584 :

For Lucene 3.0  Filter.bits() will have to be removed.

There is a CHECKME in IndexSearcher about using ConjunctionScorer to have the boolean behaviour of a Filter.

I have not looked into Filter caching yet, but I suppose there will be some room for improvement there.
Iirc the current core has moved to use OpenBitSetFilter and that is probably what is being cached.
In some cases it might be better to cache a SortedVIntList instead.

Boolean logic on DocIdSetIterator is already available for Scorers (that inherit from DocIdSetIterator) in the search package. This is currently implemented by ConjunctionScorer, DisjunctionSumScorer,
ReqOptSumScorer and ReqExclScorer.
Boolean logic on BitSets is available in contrib/misc and contrib/queries

DisjunctionSumScorer calls score() on its subscorers before the score value actually needed.
This could be a reason to introduce a DisjunctionDocIdSetIterator, perhaps as a superclass of DisjunctionSumScorer.

To fully implement non scoring queries a TermDocIdSetIterator will be needed, perhaps as a superclass of TermScorer.

The javadocs in org.apache.lucene.search using matching vs non-zero score:
I'll investigate this soon, and provide a patch when necessary.

An early version of the patches of LUCENE-584 contained a class Matcher,
that differs from the current DocIdSet in that Matcher has an explain() method.
It remains to be seen whether such a Matcher could be useful between
DocIdSet and Scorer.

The semantics of scorer.skipTo(scorer.doc()) was discussed briefly.
This was also discussed at another issue recently, so perhaps it is wortwhile to open a separate issue for this.

Skipping on a SortedVIntList is done using linear search, this could be improved by adding multilevel skiplist info much like in the Lucene index for documents containing a term.

One comment by me of 3 Dec 2008:

A few complete (test) classes are deprecated, it might be good to add the target release for removal there.

0,"java.util.logging configuration examples does not work as intendedjava.util.logging configuration examples do not work as intended. Those can be found here: http://jakarta.apache.org/httpcomponents/httpclient-3.x/logging.html

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a simple project using HttpClient (see listing below) and JDK 1.6 (I suppose it is JDK 1.4 or higher, but I did not test anything other than 1.6). Without log4j in the classpath and without any commons-logging system properties set, java.util.logging is automatically selected by commons-logging.
2. Create logging.properties file as shown in any of the java.util.logging examples
3. Run a program, passing -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties argument to the JVM

Expected results:
Quite a few log messages should be sent to System.err

Actual results:
Unless there is an I/O error encountered, no log messages are sent to System.err

The problem, as far as I can see, is caused by the default logging level of java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, which is set to INFO. In order for any log messages to go through, the log hadler log level needs to be lower than logged messages log level. Adding the following line to all java.util.logging examples should fix the problem:

java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler.level = ALL

0,"Improve StandardTokenizer's understanding of non ASCII punctuation and quotesIn the vein of LUCENE-1126 and LUCENE-1390, StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex should do a better job at understanding non-ASCII punctuation characters.

For example, its understanding of the single-quote character ""'"" is currently limited to that character only. It will set a token's type to APOSTROPHE only if the ""'"" was used.
In the patch attached, I added all the characters that ASCIIFoldingFilter would change into ""'"".

I'm not sure that this is the right approach so I didn't write a complete patch for all the other hardcoded characters used in jflex rules such as ""."", ""-"" which have some variants in ASCIIFoldingFilter that could be used as well.

0,"RepositoryFactory implementation for jcr2spiThere should be a RepositoryFactory implementation in jcr2spi that also covers acquiring the underlying RepositoryService.

For this purpose I suggest to create:
-  a RepositoryServiceFactory in jackrabbit-spi, which encapsulates the spi implementation specifc instantiation of the RepositoryService. the factory probably just needs a single method that takes a parameters map.
- a RepositoryFactory implementation in jcr2spi, which works with a URI that contains all required information to connect/acquired the RepositoryService.

To use jcr2spi/spi2jcr/jackrabbit-core:
- jcr+file://path/to/repository/home?config=repository.xml

To use jcr2spi/spi2dav:
- jcr+dav://localhost:8080/server/repository/?br=4

To use jcr2spi/spi2davex:
- jcr+davex://localhost:8080/server/repository/

An implementation of RepositoryServiceFactory must check the scheme and decide if it can handle it and create a RepositoryService instance with it, otherwise it must return null. This means there would be a single name for the connect URI for all RepositoryServiceFactory implementations.

0,"Improve BaseTokenStreamTestCase to uses a fake attribute to check if clearAttributes() was called correctly - found bugs in contrib/analyzersRobert had the idea to use a fake attribute inside BaseTokenStreamTestCase that records if its clear() method was called. If this is not the case after incrementToken(), asserTokenStreamContents fails. It also uses the attribute in TeeSinkTokenFilter, because there a lot of copying, captureState and restoreState() is used. By the attribute, you can track wonderful, if save/restore and clearAttributes is correctly implemented. It also verifies that *before* a captureState() it was also cleared (as the state will also contain the clear call). Because if you consume tokens in a filter, capture the consumed tokens and insert them, the capturedStates must also be cleared before.

In contrib analyzers are some test that fail to pass this additional assertion. They are not fixed in the attached patch."

I cannot retrieve list of objects that are directly under the path that they were saved in. I did not know where to simulate this issue and hence I have used DigesterSimpleQueryTest. I have attached the path for the newly added test case testObjectListRetrievalAtBasePath. In case the patch is not up to the mark I have attached the modified file too.

Instead of creating Page in /test if I create it in /sample/test and search in /sample/test it returns nothing but if I search in /sample it would return the object.

Another important point here is that it is causing issues while retrieving Page class, the other test cases that are retrieving Paragraph class (embedded inside Page class) are still working fine!

0,"Configuration of CacheManager memory sizes(I already posted this as comments under JCR-619.)

The maximum size for all caches in CacheManager is hardcoded to 16 megabytes and there's no way to change that. It would be nice if this as well as other CacheManager parameters were configurable. It's just a waste running Jackrabbit on a server with gigabytes of memory and only using 16 megabytes for cache...

I have created a really simple and straightforward patch (jackrabbit-cachemanager-config.patch) which enables reaching the CacheManager instance through RepositoryImpl object and setting all three of its memory parameters. The memory parameters are no longer static constants, but instance fields getting initial values from constants (so the default behavior of the class remains the same).

(It would be even nicer if these parameters were configurable via configuration files, but that should probably be implemented by someone close to the project.)"

1,"MSSqlFileSystem - JNDI & several configuration issuesthere are several configuration issues using the org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.db.MSSqlFileSystem

 <param name=""driver"" value=""javax.naming.InitialContext""/>
 <param name=""url"" value=""java:MYDatasource""/>

i have to unnecessarily specify username & password, because the MSSqlFileSystem presets them to an empty string instead of null. funnily enough  the tableSpace is preset to null, which leads to a nullpointer in createSchemaSql

xerces until 2.9.x only needs JAXP 1.3
so the only thing you need is xercesImpl.jar
and serializer.jar
serializer.jar is shared between all apache xml projects, dont know the exact version number
ok you dont need it whan you only parse xml
as soon as you want to serialize a dom tree or result of an xsl transformation you need it

but if we upgrade to latest xerces we need it [the xml-apis jar] again unless we are on java 6

1,"DbInputStream does not support mark()/reset() when exhausted.The DbDataStore implementation uses a DbInputStream to read binary properties from the database. When a new binary property is created, Jackrabbit attempts to index it. Tika's CharsetDetector is used in the process, which marks the input stream, reads the first 8000 bytes and then resets the stream.

This results in the stacktrace shown at the end of the issue, if the following two conditions hold true:
* the property is larger than the minRecordLength configuration of the Datastore and
* the property is smaller than 8000 bytes

The DbInputStream needs to have the following properties:
1. lazy instantiation of the underlying stream
2. auto-close underlying stream when EOF is reached
3. fully support mark()/reset() even if  the underlying stream is auto-closed due to 2.

0,"Minimize calls to PersistenceManagerIn some situations the PersistenceManager is called even though it is not necessary.

E.g. when new items are created the method NodeImpl.getOrCreateProperty() will always check if there is an already existing property state. If the node is new the call will always go down the full item state stack and ask the PersistenceManager if it knows the property id. This is unnessessary because there will never exist properties in the persistence manager for a new node that has not been saved yet.

I propose to add a check to the method to see if  the node is new and does not yet have a property with the given name. In that case the property can be created without further checks.

0,"Specialize BooleanQuery if all clauses are TermQueriesDuring work on LUCENE-3319 I ran into issues with BooleanQuery compared to PhraseQuery in the exact case. If I disable scoring on PhraseQuery and bypass the position matching, essentially doing a conjunction match, ExactPhraseScorer beats plain boolean scorer by 40% which is a sizeable gain. I converted a ConjunctionScorer to use DocsEnum directly but still didn't get all the 40% from PhraseQuery. Yet, it turned out with further optimizations this gets very close to PhraseQuery. The biggest gain here came from converting the hand crafted loop in ConjunctionScorer#doNext to a for loop which seems to be less confusing to hotspot. In this particular case I think code specialization makes lots of sense since BQ with TQ is by far one of the most common queries.

In some cases its is possible to rewrite the query before passing it to the highlighter to obtain a primitive query. However I had the usecase where this was not possible ie. the original index was not available on the machine which highlights the results. To still use the highlighter I had to copy a bunch of code due to visibility issues in those classes. I think we can make this extensible with minor effort to allow this usecase without massive code duplication.

public Term(String fld)
with the obvious implementation
and use it throughout core and contrib as a replacement.

0,"Use covariant clone() return types*Paul Cowan wrote in LUCENE-1257:*

OK, thought I'd jump in and help out here with one of my Java 5 favourites. Haven't seen anyone discuss this, and don't believe any of the patches address this, so thought I'd throw a patch out there (against SVN HEAD @ revision 827821) which uses Java 5 covariant return types for (almost) all of the Object#clone() implementations in core. 
i.e. this:

public Object clone() {
changes to:
public SpanNotQuery clone() {

which lets us get rid of a whole bunch of now-unnecessary casts, so e.g.

if (clone == null) clone = (SpanNotQuery) this.clone();
becomes
if (clone == null) clone = this.clone();

Almost everything has been done and all downcasts removed, in core, with the exception of

Some SpanQuery stuff, where it's assumed that it's safe to cast the clone() of a SpanQuery to a SpanQuery - this can't be made covariant without declaring ""abstract SpanQuery clone()"" in SpanQuery itself, which breaks those SpanQuerys that don't declare their own clone() 
Some IndexReaders, e.g. DirectoryReader - we can't be more specific than changing .clone() to return IndexReader, because it returns the result of IndexReader.clone(boolean). We could use covariant types for THAT, which would work fine, but that didn't follow the pattern of the others so that could be a later commit. 
Two changes were also made in contrib/, where not making the changes would have broken code by trying to widen IndexInput#clone() back out to returning Object, which is not permitted. contrib/ was otherwise left untouched.

Let me know what you think, or if you have any other questions."

    http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-dev/200608.mbox/%3c44E5B16D.4010805@mikemccandless.com%3e

The approach is a small modification over the original discussion (see
Retry Logic below).  It works correctly in all my cross-machine test
case, but I want to open it up for feedback, testing by
users/developers in more diverse environments, etc.

This is a small change to how lucene stores its index that enables
elimination of the commit lock entirely.  The write lock still
remains.

Of the two, the commit lock has been more troublesome for users since
it typically serves an active role in production.  Whereas the write
lock is usually more of a design check to make sure you only have one
writer against the index at a time.

The basic idea is that filenames are never reused (""write once""),
meaning, a writer never writes to a file that a reader may be reading
(there is one exception: the segments.gen file; see ""RETRY LOGIC""
below).  Instead it writes to generational files, ie, segments_1, then
segments_2, etc.  Besides the segments file, the .del files and norm
files (.sX suffix) are also now generational.  A generation is stored
as an ""_N"" suffix before the file extension (eg, _p_4.s0 is the
separate norms file for segment ""p"", generation 4).

One important benefit of this is it avoids files contents caching
entirely (the likely cause of errors when readers open an index
mounted on NFS) since the file is always a new file.

With this patch I can reliably instantiate readers over NFS when a
writer is writing to the index.  However, with NFS, you are still forced to
refresh your reader once a writer has committed because ""point in
time"" searching doesn't work over NFS (see LUCENE-673 ).

The changes are fully backwards compatible: you can open an old index
for searching, or to add/delete docs, etc.  I've added a new unit test
to test these cases.

All units test pass, and I've added a number of additional unit tests,
some of which fail on WIN32 in the current lucene but pass with this
patch.  The ""fileformats.xml"" has been updated to describe the changes
to the files (but XXX references need to be fixed before committing).

There are some other important benefits:

  * Readers are now entirely read-only.

  * Readers no longer block one another (false contention) on
    initialization.

  * On hitting contention, we immediately retry instead of a fixed
    (default 1.0 second now) pause.

  * No file renaming is ever done.  File renaming has caused sneaky
    access denied errors on WIN32 (see LUCENE-665 ).  (Yonik, I used
    your approach here to not rename the segments_N file(try
    segments_(N-1) on hitting IOException on segments_N): the separate
    "".done"" file did not work reliably under very high stress testing
    when a directory listing was not ""point in time"").

  * On WIN32, you can now call IndexReader.setNorm() even if other
    readers have the index open (fixes a pre-existing minor bug in
    Lucene).

  * On WIN32, You can now create an IndexWriter with create=true even
    if readers have the index open (eg see
    www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/39265) .


Here's an overview of the changes:

  * Every commit writes to the next segments_(N+1).

  * Loading the segments_N file (& opening the segments) now requires
    retry logic.  I've captured this logic into a new static class:
    SegmentInfos.FindSegmentsFile.  All places that need to do
    something on the current segments file now use this class.

  * No more deletable file.  Instead, the writer computes what's
    deletable on instantiation and updates this in memory whenever
    files can be deleted (ie, when it commits).  Created a common
    class index.IndexFileDeleter shared by reader & writer, to manage
    deletes.

  * Storing more information into segments info file: whether it has
    separate deletes (and which generation), whether it has separate
    norms, per field (and which generation), whether it's compound or
    not.  This is instead of relying on IO operations (file exists
    calls).  Note that this fixes the current misleading
    FileNotFoundException users now see when an _X.cfs file is missing
    (eg http://www.nabble.com/FileNotFound-Exception-t6987.html).

  * Fixed some small things about RAMDirectory that were not
    filesystem-like (eg opening a non-existent IndexInput failed to
    raise IOException; renames were not atomic).  I added a stress
    test against a RAMDirectory (1 writer thread & 2 reader threads)
    that uncovered these.

  * Added option to not remove old files when create=true on creating
    FSDirectory; this is so the writer can do its own [more
    sophisticated because it retries on errors] removal.

  * Removed all references to commit lock, COMMIT_LOCK_TIMEOUT, etc.
    (This is an API change).

  * Extended index/IndexFileNames.java and index/IndexFileNameFilter.java
    with logic for computing generational file names.

  * Changed index/IndexFileNameFilter.java to use a HashSet to check
    file extentsions for better performance.

  * Fixed the test case TestIndexReader.testLastModified: it was
    incorrectly (I think?) comparing lastModified to version, of the
    index.  I fixed that and then added a new test case for version.


Retry Logic (in index/SegmentInfos.java)

If a reader tries to load the segments just as a writer is committing,
it may hit an IOException.  This is just normal contention.  In
current Lucene contention causes a [default] 1.0 second pause then
retry.  With lock-less the contention causes no added delay beyond the
time to retry.

When this happens, we first try segments_(N-1) if present, because it
could be segments_N is still being written.  If that fails, we
re-check to see if there is now a newer segments_M where M > N and
advance if so.  Else we retry segments_N once more (since it could be
it was in process previously but must now be complete since
segments_(N-1) did not load).

In order to find the current segments_N file, I list the directory and
take the biggest segments_N that exists.

However, under extreme stress testing (5 threads just opening &
closing readers over and over), on one platform (OS X) I found that
the directory listing can be incorrect (stale) by up to 1.0 seconds.
This means the listing will show a segments_N file but that file does
not exist (fileExists() returns false).

In order to handle this (and other such platforms), I switched to a
hybrid approach (originally proposed by Doron Cohen in the original
thread): on committing, the writer writes to a file ""segments.gen"" the
generation it just committed.  It writes 2 identical longs into this
file.  The retry logic, on detecting that the directory listing is
stale falls back to the contents of this file.  If that file is
consistent (the two longs are identical), and, the generation is
indeed newer than the dir listing, it will use that.

Finally, if this approach is also stale, we fallback to stepping
through sequential generations (up to a maximum # tries).  If all 3
methods fail, we throw the original exception we hit.

I added a static method SegmentInfos.setInfoStream() which will print
details of retry attempts.  In the patch it's set to System.out right
now (we should turn off before a real commit) so if there are problems
we can see what retry logic had done.

0,"CustomScoreQuery (function query) is broken (due to per-segment searching)Spinoff from here:

  http://lucene.markmail.org/message/psw2m3adzibaixbq

With the cutover to per-segment searching, CustomScoreQuery is not really usable anymore, because the per-doc custom scoring method (customScore) receives a per-segment docID, yet there is no way to figure out which segment you are currently searching.

I think to fix this we must also notify the subclass whenever a new segment is switched to.  I think if we copy Collector.setNextReader, that would be sufficient.  It would by default do nothing in CustomScoreQuery, but a subclass could override."
1,"BooleanQuery explain with boost==0BooleanWeight.explain() uses the returned score of subweights to determine if a clause matched.
If any required clause has boost==0, the returned score will be zero and the explain for the entire BooleanWeight will be simply  Explanation(0.0f, ""match required"").

I'm not sure what the correct fix is here.  I don't think it can be done based on score alone, since that isn't how scorers work.   Perhaps we need a new method ""boolean Explain.matched()"" that returns true on a match, regardless of what the score may be? 

Related to the problem above, even if no boosts are zero, it it sometimes nice to know *why* a particular query failed to match.  It would mean a longer explanation, but maybe we should include non matching explains too?"

1,Benchmark deletes.alg failsBenchmark deletes.alg fails because the index reader defaults to open readonly.  
1,"Lucene fails to close file handles under certain situationsAs a followon to LUCENE-820, I've added a further check in
MockRAMDirectory to assert that there are no open files when the
directory is closed.

That check caused a few unit tests to fail, and in digging into the
reason I uncovered these cases where Lucene fails to close file
handles:

  * TermInfosReader.close() was setting its ThreadLocal enumerators to
    null without first closing the SegmentTermEnum in there.  It looks
    like this was part of the fix for LUCENE-436.  I just added the
    call to close.

    This is somewhat severe since we could leak many file handles for
    use cases that burn through threads and/or indexes.  Though,
    FSIndexInput does have a finalize() to close itself.

  * Flushing of deletes in IndexWriter opens SegmentReader to do the
    flushing, and it correctly calls close() to close the reader.  But
    if an exception is hit during commit and before actually closing,
    it will leave open those handles.  I fixed this first calling
    doCommit() and then doClose() in a finally.  The ""disk full"" tests
    we now have were hitting this.

  * IndexWriter's addIndexes(IndexReader[]) method was opening a
    reader but not closing it with a try/finally.  I just put a
    try/finally in.

I've also changed some unit tests to use MockRAMDirectory instead of
RAMDirectory to increase testing coverage of ""leaking open file
handles"".

1,"CartesianPolyFilterBuilder doesn't handle edge case around the 180 meridianTest case:  
Points all around the globe, plus two points at 0, 179.9 and 0,-179.9 (on each side of the meridian).  Then, do a Cartesian Tier filter on a point right near those two.  It will return all the points when it should just return those two.

The flawed logic is in the else clause below:

		if (longX == 0.0) {
			longX = longX2;

Intblock further enables the docs, freqs, pos files to encode fixed-sized blocks of ints at a time.

So an app can easily ""subclass"" these codecs, using their own int encoder.

But these codecs are now concrete, and they use dummy low-level block int encoder (eg encoding 128 ints as separate vints).

I'd like to change these to be abstract, and move these dummy codecs into test.

The tests would still test these dummy codecs, by rotating them in randomly for all tests.

I was able to build it without a problem using maven-1.1-beta-2 and JDK 1.4.2.

However, it sounds to me like in your case maven has set up its
on-build classpath so that it sees the older xerces-2.4.0.jar before
the new xerxesImpl.-2.6.2.jar. Maven seems to download the old
xerces-2.4.0 into its repository for internal use, while my code uses
the newer xerxesImpl-2.6.2.jar. The old jar overlaps class-wise with
the new one, but the new one implements the additional loadURI method
(among others).

I am not sure exactly why your maven build process is looking in the
wrong jar. But that is what is doing, almost certainly.

0,"Failures during contrib builds, when classes in core were changed without ant cleanFrom java-dev by Shai Erera:

{quote}
I've noticed that sometimes, after I run test-core and test-contrib, and then change core code, test-contrib fail on NoSuchMethodError and stuff like that. I've noticed that core.jar exists under build, and I assumed it's used by test-contrib, and probably is not recreated after core code has changed.

I verified it when looking in contrib-build.xml, which defines a property lucene.jar.present which is set to true if the jar is ... well, present. Which I believe is the reason for these failures. I've been thinking how to resolve that, and I can think of two ways:

(1) have test-core always delete that file, but that has two issues:
(1.1) It's redundant if the code hasn't changed.
(1.2) It forces you to either jar-core or test-core before you test-contrib, if you want to make sure you run w/ the latest jar.

or

(2) have test-contrib always call jar-core, which will first delete the file and then re-create it by compiling first. Compiling should not do anything if the code hasn't changed. So the only waste would be to create the .jar, but I think that's quite fast?

Does anyone, with more Ant skills than me, know of a better way to detect from test-contrib that core code has changed and only then rebuild the jar?

0,"Default lock timeouts should have static setter/getters
We recently stopped using Java system properties to derive defaults for things like the write/commit lock timeout, and switched to getter/setter's across all classes.  See here:

    http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/27447

But, in the case at least of the write lock timeout, because it's marked ""public final static"", a consumer of this API can no longer change this value before instantiating the IndexWriter.  This is because the getter/setter for this is not static, which generally makes sense so you can change the timeout for each instance of IndexWriter.  But because IndexWriter on construction uses the timeout value, some uses cases need to change the value before getting an instance of IndexWriter.

This was actually a regression, in that Lucene users lost functionality they previously had, on upgrading.

I would propose that that we add getter/setter for the default value of this timeout, which would be static.  I'll attach a patch file.

with one other rather than with any kind of custom clients, i suggest to add a simple fix by patching the parts used
within spi2davex.

btw: in HttpClient 4.x there seems to be a workaround for this problem [2]

0,"Improve performance of CharTermAttribute(Impl) and also fully implement AppendableThe Appendable.append(CharSequence) method in CharTermAttributes is good for general use. But like StringBuilder has for some common use cases specialized methods, this does the same and adds separate append methods for String, StringBuilder and CharTermAttribute itsself. This methods enable the compiler to directly link the specialized methods and don't use the instanceof checks. The unspecialized method only does the instanceof checks for longer CharSequences (>8 chars), else it simply iterates.

This patch also fixes the required special ""null"" handling. append() methods are required by Appendable to append ""null"", if the argument is null. I dont like this, but its required. Maybe we should document, that we dont dont support it. Otherwise, JDK's formatter fails with formatting null."

By using the name in the path, I must set the value to 'queries' (since the path is contrib/queries).  However because the project name is now queries-contrib, the actual jar file will be lucene-queries-contrib-${version}.jar, not lucene-queries-${version}.jar, as is expected.

0,"Modify ParallelMultiSearcher to use a CompletionService instead of slowly polling for resultsRight now, the parallel multi searcher creates an array/list of Future<V> representing each of the searchables that's being concurrently searched (and its corresponding search task).

As it stands, once the tasks are all submitted to the executor, the array is iterated over, FIFO, and Future.get() is called iteratively.  This obviously works, but isn't ideal.  It's entirely possible (a situation I've run into) where one of the first searchables represents a large index that takes a long time to search, so the results of the other searchables can't be processed until the large index is done searching.  In my case, we have two indexes with several million records that get searched in front of some other indexes, the smallest of which has only a few ten thousand entries and I didn't think it was ideal for the results of the other indexes to wait.

I've modified ParallelMultiSearcher to use CompletionServices instead, so that results are processed in the order they are completed, rather than the order that they are submitted.  All the tests still pass, and to the best of my knowledge this won't break anything.  This have several advantages:
1) Speed - the thread owning the executor doesn't have to wait for the first submitted task to finish in order to process the results of the other tasks, which may have finished first
2) Removed several warnings (even if they are annotated away) due to the ugliness of typecasting generic arrays.
3) Decreased the complexity of the code in some cases, usually by removing the necessity of allocating and filling arrays.

With a primed ""cache"" of searchables, I was getting 700-1200 ms per search, and using the same phrases, with this patch, I am now getting 400-500ms per search :)

0,"Speedup merging of stored fields when field mapping ""matches""Robert Engels suggested the following idea, here:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/54217

When merging in the stored fields from a segment, if the field name ->
number mapping is identical then we can simply bulk copy the entire
entry for the document rather than re-interpreting and then re-writing
the actual stored fields.

I've pulled the code from the above thread and got it working on the

0,"wordlistloader is inefficientWordListLoader is basically used for loading up stopwords lists, stem dictionaries, etc.
Unfortunately the api returns Set<String> and sometimes even HashSet<String> or HashMap<String,String>

If someone objects to breaking it in 3.1, then we can do this only in 4.0, but i think it would be good to fix it both places.
The reason is that if someone does new FooAnalyzer() a lot (probably not uncommon) i think its doing a bunch of useless copying.

I think we should slap @lucene.internal on this API too, since thats mostly how its being used.

0,"Disable SearchManagerIn previous versions (e.g. SVN tag 0.1-spec0.14) it was possible to disable the SearchManagers by not configuring a search index path. In the current revision, a NullPointerException is thrown, if the search index configuration is missing, tough the rest of the system would support missing search index configuration as before.

I suggest to extend search index configuration interpretation in WorkspaceCfg.init as follows:

        Element srchConfig = wspElem.getChild(SEARCH_INDEX_ELEMENT);
        if (srchConfig != null) {
            String pathAttr = srchConfig.getAttributeValue(PATH_ATTRIB);

                searchIndexDir = replaceVars(pathAttr, vars);
            }
        }

This only reads search index configuration if available.

The reason to switch of the SearchManager is, that in my use case enabling the SearchManager yields a performance degradation of a factor of 10 ! Instead of taking around 500ms (which is still too long :-) to save 3 nodes and 15 properties, it would take around 5 seconds to save the same amount of data. And I do not need the SearchManager in my use case."

0,"allow tests to use different Directory implsNow that all tests use MockRAMDirectory instead of RAMDirectory, they are all picky like windows and force our tests to

# LuceneTestCase[J4] tracks if all dirs are closed at tearDown and also cleans up temp dirs like solr.
# factor out the Mockish stuff from MockRAMDirectory into MockDirectoryWrapper
# allow a -Dtests.directoryImpl or simpler to specify the default Directory to use for tests: default being ""random""

i think theres a chance we might find some bugs that havent yet surfaced because they are easier to trigger with FSDir
Furthermore, this would be beneficial to Directory-implementors as they could run the entire testsuite against their Directory impl, just like codec-implementors can do now.

1,"CloseableThreadLocal does not work well with Tomcat thread poolingWe tracked down a large memory leak (effectively a leak anyway) caused
by how Analyzer users CloseableThreadLocal.
CloseableThreadLocal.hardRefs holds references to Thread objects as
keys.  The problem is that it only frees these references in the set()
method, and SnowballAnalyzer will only call set() when it is used by a
NEW thread.

The problem scenario is as follows:

The server experiences a spike in usage (say by robots or whatever)
and many threads are created and referenced by
CloseableThreadLocal.hardRefs.  The server quiesces and lets many of
these threads expire normally.  Now we have a smaller, but adequate
thread pool.  So CloseableThreadLocal.set() may not be called by
SnowBallAnalyzer (via Analyzer) for a _long_ time.  The purge code is
never called, and these threads along with their thread local storage
(lucene related or not) is never cleaned up.

I think calling the purge code in both get() and set() would have
avoided this problem, but is potentially expensive.  Perhaps using 
WeakHashMap instead of HashMap may also have helped.  WeakHashMap 
purges on get() and set().  So this might be an efficient way to
clean up threads in get(), while set() might do the more expensive
Map.keySet() iteration.

Our current work around is to not share SnowBallAnalyzer instances
among HTTP searcher threads.  We open and close one on every request.

Thanks,
Matt"
0,"Configure Maximum Connection LifetimesProvide a means of configuring a maximum lifetime for HttpClient connections.  Currently, it would appear as long as a connection is used it may persist indefinitely.

This would be useful for situations where HttpClient needs to react to DNS changes, such as the following situation that may occur when using DNS load balancing:
 - HttpClient maintains connections to example.com which resolves to IP A
 - Machine at IP A fails, and example.com now resolves to backup machine at IP B
 - Since IP A is failing, connections are destroyed, and new connections are made to IP B
 - Machine at IP A recovers, but HttpClient maintains connections to IP B since the connections are still healthy

The desired behavior would be that connections to IP B will reach their connection lifetime, and new connections could be created back to IP A according to the updated DNS settings."

0,"[PATCH] new method expungeDeleted() added to IndexWriterWe make use the docIDs in lucene. I need a way to compact the docIDs in segments
to remove the ""holes"" created from doing deletes. The only way to do this is by
calling IndexWriter.optimize(). This is a very heavy call, for the cases where
the index is large but with very small number of deleted docs, calling optimize
is not practical.

I need a new method: expungeDeleted(), which finds all the segments that have
delete documents and merge only those segments.

I have implemented this method and have discussed with Otis about submitting a
patch. I don't see where I can attached the patch. I will do according to the

0,"Add oal.util.Version ctor to QueryParserThis is a followup of LUCENE-1987:

If somebody uses StandardAnalyzer with Version.LUCENE_CURRENT and then uses QueryParser, phrase queries will not work, because the StopFilter enables position Increments for stop words, but QueryParser ignores them per default. The user has to explicitely enable them.

This issue would add a ctor taking the Version constant and automatically enable this setting. The same applies to the contrib queryparser. Eventually also StopAnalyzer should add this version ctor.

To be able to remove the default ctor for 3.0 (to remove a possible trap for users of QueryParser), it must be deprecated and the new one also added to 2.9.1."

1,"DBDataStore doesn't support concurrent readsMy understanding is that setting parameter copyWhenReading to true should allow concurrent reads by spooling binary property to temporary file and free database resources (connection) immediately to make it available for other threads.

After applying patch for JCR-1388, DBDataStore doesn't support concurrent reads anymore, resultSet is kept open and db connection is blocked until the stream is read and closed. When copyWhenReading is set to true db connection should be released immediately, this is the reason i guess why temporary file is used."
0,"New Analyzer for buffering tokensIn some cases, it would be handy to have Analyzer/Tokenizer/TokenFilters that could siphon off certain tokens and store them in a buffer to be used later in the processing pipeline.

For example, if you want to have two fields, one lowercased and one not, but all the other analysis is the same, then you could save off the tokens to be output for a different field.

Patch to follow, but I am still not sure about a couple of things, mostly how it plays with the new reuse API.

0,"back-compat tests (""ant test-tag"") should test JAR drop-in-ability
We now test back-compat with ""ant test-tag"", which is very useful for
catching breaks in back compat before committing.

However, that currently checks out ""src/test"" sources and then
compiles them against the trunk JAR, and runs the tests.  Whereas our
back compat policy:

  http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/BackwardsCompatibility

states that no recompilation is required on upgrading to a new JAR.
Ie you should be able to drop in the new JAR in place of your old one
and things should work fine.

So... we should fix ""ant test-tag"" to:

  * Do full checkout of core sources & tests from the back-compat-tag

  * Compile the JAR from the back-compat sources

  * Compile the tests against that back-compat JAR

  * Swap in the trunk JAR

  * Run the tests

0,"Optimize usage of normsThere is a very significant potential for optimizing the size of the search index.

We have seen a case where there were multiple segments with about the same number of nodes (roughly 10 million), but the size on disk was very different.
One segment was 19 GB while all others where around 3 GB. The major difference was the number of fields indexed. The large segment had significantly more fields, which resulted in a large norms file.

We should go through our implementation and see where norms are really necessary and disable tracking of norms wherever possible."
0,"Upgrade JUnit to 4.10, refactor state-machine of detecting setUp/tearDown call chaining.Both Lucene and Solr use JUnit 4.7. I suggest we move forward and upgrade to JUnit 4.10 which provides several infrastructural changes (serializable Description objects, class-level rules, various tweaks). JUnit 4.10 also changes (or fixes, depends how you look at it) the order in which @Before/@After hooks and @Rules are applied. This makes the old state-machine in LuceneTestCase fail (because the order is changed).

I rewrote the state machine and used a different, I think simpler, although Uwe may disagree :), mechanism in which the hook methods setUp/ tearDown are still there, but they are empty at the top level and serve only to detect whether subclasses chain super.setUp/tearDown properly (if they override anything).

In the long term, I would love to just get rid of public setup/teardown methods and make them private (so that they cannot be overriden or even seen by subclasses) but this will require changes to the runner itself."
0,"better handling of files inside/outside CFS by codecSince norms and deletes were moved under Codec (LUCENE-3606, LUCENE-3661),
we never really properly addressed the issue of how Codec.files() should work,
considering these files are always stored outside of CFS.

LUCENE-3606 added a hack, LUCENE-3661 cleaned up the hack a little bit more,
but its still a hack.

Currently the logic in SegmentInfo.files() is:
{code}
clearCache()

if (compoundFile) {
  // don't call Codec.files(), hardcoded CFS extensions, etc
} else {
  Codec.files()
}

// always add files stored outside CFS regardless of CFS setting
Codec.separateFiles()

if (sharedDocStores) {
  // hardcoded shared doc store extensions, etc
}
{code}

Also various codec methods take a Directory parameter, but its inconsistent
what this Directory is in the case of CFS: for some parts of the index its
the CFS directory, for others (deletes, separate norms) its not.

I wonder if instead we could restructure this so that SegmentInfo.files() logic is:
{code}
clearCache()
Codec.files()
{code}

and so that Codec is instead responsible.

instead Codec.files logic by default would do the if (compoundFile) thing, and
Lucene3x codec itself would only have the if (sharedDocStores) thing, and any
part of the codec that wants to put stuff always outside of CFS (e.g. Lucene3x separate norms, deletes) 
could just use SegmentInfo.dir. Directory parameters in the case of CFS would always
consistently be the CFSDirectory.

I haven't totally tested if this will work but there is definitely some cleanups 
we can do either way, and I think it would be a good step to try to clean this up
and simplify it.

I dug for a while... the test is a bit sneaky because it compares sorted docs (by score) across 2 indexes.  Index #1 has no deletions; Index #2 has same docs, but organized into doc blocks by group, and has some deletions.

0,"Add QueryParser.newFieldQueryNote: this patch changes no behavior, just makes QP more subclassable.

Currently we have Query getFieldQuery(String field, String queryText, boolean quoted)
This contains very hairy methods for producing a query from QP's analyzer.

I propose we factor this into newFieldQuery(Analyzer analyzer, String field, String queryText, boolean quoted)
Then getFieldQuery just calls newFieldQuery(this.analyzer, field, queryText, quoted);

The reasoning is: it can be quite useful to consider the double quote as more than phrases, but a ""more exact"" search.
In the case the user quoted the terms, you might want to analyze the text with an alternate analyzer that:
doesn't produce synonyms, doesnt decompose compounds, doesn't use WordDelimiterFilter 
(you would need to be using preserveOriginal=true at index time for the WDF one), etc etc.

This is similar to the way google's double quote operator works, its not defined as phrase but ""this exact wording or phrase"".
For example compare results to a query of tests versus ""tests"".

Currently you can do this without heavy code duplication, but really only if you make a separate field (which is wasteful),
and make your custom QP lie about its field... in the examples I listed above you can do this with a single field, yet still
have a more exact phrase search.

0,"Add API for selective bundle consistency check (Jackrabbit-specific)Add a jackrabbit-specific API for doing a selective consistencyCheck, ie. on single nodes. The current entire-workspace check can be very slow if there workspace is large enough. Also it should be easy to write a tool to invoke that feature programmatically rather than by configuration + restart (see below).

Existing Implementation:
The current bundle consistencyCheck feature is enabled by setting a bundle PM parameter and restarting Jackrabbit, it will then run upon startup (see JCR-972 for the only issue regarding bundle consistency check). This check looks for broken parent-child relationships, ie. it will remove any child node entries that reference non-existing parent nodes. For non-existing parent UUIDs and other problems in bundles it will log those.

Outlook:
An advanced consistencyCheck could also check for non-existing version nodes and vice-versa (see JCR-630), but this is not the focus of this issue and could be a later addition to the API."

old and new syntax are incompatible."
0,"Demo: DeleteFiles doesn't delete files by their path namesIt appears that delete(term) fails to delete the last document containing term, which
for a unique match means that you can't remove an individual document.

Code attempting to remove document with specific 'path' (slightly modified version of demo code):

Directory directory = FSDirectory.getDirectory(""index"", false);
IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(directory);
Term term = new Term(""path"", args[0]);  // path passed via command line arg
int deleted = reader.delete(term);
reader.close();
directory.close();

System.out.println(""deleted "" + deleted + "" documents containing "" + term);

Executing this always returns ""deleted 0 documents containing <path entered>""

In IndexReader.java, delete() has:

public final int delete(Term term) throws IOException {
  TermDocs docs = termDocs(term);
  if (docs == null) return 0;
  int n = 0;
  try {
    while (docs.next()) {
      delete(docs.doc());
      n++;
    }
  } finally {
    docs.close();
  }
  return n;
}

It appears that docs.next() always returns false when there is only one doc, hence
delete() is never called and 0 is always returned.  I assume that this also means that
if there are multiple matches, the last doc will not be deleted either, but I have not tested
that.

I modified the code as follows:

    boolean more = true;
    try {
      docs.next();
      while (more) {
        delete(docs.doc());
        n++;
        more = docs.next();
      }
    } finally {
      docs.close();
    }

and then it worked as expected (at least attempts to delete a single document from the
index succeeded whereas previously they did not)."
1,"Lock expires almost immediatelyWhen a timeoutHint other than Long.MAX_VALUE is given to the javax.jcr.lock.LockManager API:

   lock(String absPath, boolean isDeep, boolean isSessionScoped, long timeoutHint, String ownerInfo)

   long now = (System.currentTimeMillis() + 999) / 1000; // round up
   this.timeoutTime = now + timeoutHint;

the TimeoutHandler in o.a.j.core.lock.LockManagerImpl running every second will then check whether the timeout has expired (o.a.j.core.lock.LockInfo#isExpired):

    public boolean isExpired() {
        return timeoutTime != Long.MAX_VALUE
            && timeoutTime * 1000 > System.currentTimeMillis();

0,"DocId.UUIDDocId should not have a string attr uuidAfter JCR-1213 will be solved, lots of DocId.UUIDDocId can be cached, and not being cleaned after every gc(). The number of cached UUIDDocId can grow very large, depending on the size of the repository.  Therefor, instead of storing the private String uuid; we can make it more memory efficient by storing 2 long's, the lsb and msb of the uuid.  Storing 1.000.000 of parent UUIDDocId might differ about 100Mb of memory. 

I even did test by removing the entire uuid string, and not use msb or lsb, because, when everything works properly (with references to index reader segments (See JCR-1213)), the uuid is never needed again: in 

UUIDDocId getDocumentNumber(IndexReader reader) throws IOException {

we could set uuid = null just before the return. It works perfectly well, because when an index reader is recreated, the CachingIndexReader will be recreated, hence DocId[] parents will be recreated. 

So, IMO, I think we might be able to remove the uuid entirely when the docNumber is found in DocId.UUIDDocId (obviously after JCR-1213)

1,"ZombieHierarchyManager can return wrong child node entries for replaced nodesThe ZombieHierarchyManager currently implements the two getChildNodeEntry methods like this:

1) look up child node in old, overlayed state, which might contain removed child nodes
2) if not found, ask the super implementation (ie. get the child node from the up-to-date list)

The purpose of the ZombieHM is to be able to return removed item ids from the attic. However, the behavior above is IMO wrong, as it should first find an existing child node with the given name (or id):

1) look up child node in super implementation (ie. get the child node from the up-to-date list)
2) if not found, look in the old, overlayed state if it might have been removed

I was able to reproduce this issue when replacing a node (but note the custom access manager in 1.4.x used as explained below): create /replaced/subnode structure, save the session, remove the replaced node and add /replaced and then /replaced/subnode again:

        Node rootNode = session.getRootNode();
        
        // 1. create structure /replaced/subnode
        Node test = rootNode.addNode(""replaced"", NT);
        test.addNode(""subnode"", NT);
        // 2. persist changes
        session.save();

        // 3. remove node and recreate it
        test.remove();
        test = rootNode.addNode(""replaced"", NT);
        
        // 4. create previous child with same name
        test.addNode(""subnode"", NT);
        
        // 5. => gives exception
        test.getNode(""subnode"").getNodes();

To complicate things further, this was only triggered by a custom access manager, and all based upon Jackrabbit 1.4.x. Back then (pre-1.5 and new security stuff era), the access manager would get a ZombieHM as its hierarchy manager. If its implementation called resolvePath() on the HM for checking read-access in the final getNodes() call, where the tree will be traversed using the getChildNdeEntry(NodeState, Name, int) method, it would get the old node id and hence fail if it would try to retrieve it from the real item state manager.

Thus with a Jackrabbit >= 1.5 and 2.0 the above code will work fine, because the ZombieHM is not used.

However, we might want to fix it for 1.4.x and also check the other uses of the ZombieHM in the current trunk, which I couldn't test. These are (explicit and implicit): ChangeLogBasedHierarchyMgr, SessionItemStateManager.getDescendantTransientItemStates(NodeId), ItemImpl.validateTransientItems(Iterable<ItemState>, Iterable<ItemState>) and SessionItemStateManager.getDescendantTransientItemStatesInAttic(NodeId).

0,"Enable flexible scoringThis is a first step (nowhere near committable!), implementing the
design iterated to in the recent ""Baby steps towards making Lucene's
scoring more flexible"" java-dev thread.

The idea is (if you turn it on for your Field; it's off by default) to
store full stats in the index, into a new _X.sts file, per doc (X
field) in the index.

And then have FieldSimilarityProvider impls that compute doc's boost
bytes (norms) from these stats.

The patch is able to index the stats, merge them when segments are
merged, and provides an iterator-only API.  It also has starting point
for per-field Sims that use the stats iterator API to compute boost
bytes.  But it's not at all tied into actual searching!  There's still
tons left to do, eg, how does one configure via Field/FieldType which
stats one wants indexed.

All tests pass, and I added one new TestStats unit test.

The stats I record now are:

  - field's boost

  - field's unique term count (a b c a a b --> 3)

  - field's total term count (a b c a a b --> 6)

  - total term count per-term (sum of total term count for all docs
    that have this term)

Still need at least the total term count for each field.

1,"JCR Server has concurrency issues on JcrWebdavServer.SessionCache internal HashMap cachesAfter doing the davex remoting performance work outlined in JCR-3026, the increased concurrency on my jcr server exposed a lot of errors related to getting and putting from the JcrWebdavServer.SessionCache's internal HashMap's.  This problem with HashMap's is a well known concurrency error and was easily fixed by upgrading these maps to ConcurrentHashMaps.  Performance seems dramatically better.  

The fix includes exposure of a tuning parameter that allows the user to set the expected concurrency level.  This is the number of concurrent requests you expect the server to be handling.  In the typical davex remoting scenario, this means you should tune this server side value to match the total max connections of all clients pointed at the server.  See JCR-3026.

0,"JCR Test for Adding Node Type Tests That Abstract Nodes Can Be Added as Children, contrary to JCR 2.0 specificationWhen the TCK test method testLegalAndResidualType in the CanAddChildNodeCallWithNodeTypeTest class picks a node with a residual type, it does not filter out abstract nodes.  For example, in my local test, nt:hierarchyNode is selected for the local variable 'type'.

Since abstract node types ""cannot be directly assigned to a node,""[1] canAddChildNode(anyPropertyName, ""nt:hierarchyNode"") must return false.  However, since the test assumes that a non-abstract node type was chosen, it expects canAddChildNode(String, String) to return true.

This could be fixed if NodeTypeUtil.locateChildNodeDef(...) were extended to add an extra argument allowing or disallowing abstract types and that extra argument was used to filter the type used in testLegalAndResidualType (or if locateChildNodeDef(...) automatically excluded abstract types in the same manner that it automatically excludes protected types).

It would be useful if the method =Filter.bits()= returned an abstract interface, instead of =java.util.BitSet=.

Use case: there is a very large index, and, depending on the user's privileges, only a small portion of the index is actually visible.
Sparsely populated =java.util.BitSet=s are not efficient and waste lots of memory. It would be desirable to have an alternative BitSet implementation with smaller memory footprint.

Though it _is_ possibly to derive classes from =java.util.BitSet=, it was obviously not designed for that purpose.
That's why I propose to use an interface instead. The default implementation could still delegate to =java.util.BitSet=.

0,"Move UnInvertedField into Lucene coreSolr's UnInvertedField lets you quickly lookup all terms ords for a
given doc/field.

Like, FieldCache, it inverts the index to produce this, and creates a
RAM-resident data structure holding the bits; but, unlike FieldCache,
it can handle multiple values per doc, and, it does not hold the term
bytes in RAM.  Rather, it holds only term ords, and then uses
TermsEnum to resolve ord -> term.

This is great eg for faceting, where you want to use int ords for all
of your counting, and then only at the end you need to resolve the
""top N"" ords to their text.

I think this is a useful core functionality, and we should move most
of it into Lucene's core.  It's a good complement to FieldCache.  For
this first baby step, I just move it into core and refactor Solr's
usage of it.

After this, as separate issues, I think there are some things we could
explore/improve:

  * The first-pass that allocates lots of tiny byte[] looks like it
    could be inefficient.  Maybe we could use the byte slices from the
    indexer for this...

  * We can improve the RAM efficiency of the TermIndex: if the codec
    supports ords, and we are operating on one segment, we should just
    use it.  If not, we can use a more RAM-efficient data structure,
    eg an FST mapping to the ord.

  * We may be able to improve on the main byte[] representation by
    using packed ints instead of delta-vInt?

  * Eventually we should fold this ability into docvalues, ie we'd
    write the byte[] image at indexing time, and then loading would be
    fast, instead of uninverting

0,"bad java practices which affect performance (result of code inspection)IntelliJ IDEA found the following issues in the Lucense source code and tests:

1) explicit for loops where calls to System.arraycopy() should have been
2) calls to Boolean constructor (in stead of the appropriate static method/field)
3) instantiation of unnecessary Integer instances for toString, instead of calling the static one
4) String concatenation using + inside a call to StringBuffer.append(), in stead of chaining the append calls

all minor issues. patch is forthcoming.

0,Use bundle persistence in default configurationThe default repository configuration files in jackrabbit-core and -webapp still use the old simple database persistence. They should be updated to use bundle persistence in the 1.4 release.
1,"nt:versionedChild problemProblem occurs when both parent and child beans are versionable.  Jackrabbit creates an nt:versionedChild node that is referenced by the parent node, referencing the childs versionedHistory node of the child.  The current OCM code does not handle this correctly and produces an error:  ""Node type  'nt:versionedChild' does not match descriptor node type 'nt:unstructured'""

Below is a example code of the problem and a patch that appears to correctly resolve the problem.


 Within ObjectConverterImpl created the below method.

        public Node getActualNode(Session session,Node node) throws
 RepositoryException
        {
                NodeType type = node.getPrimaryNodeType();
                if (type.getName().equals(""nt:versionedChild""))
                {

                        String uuid =
 node.getProperty(""jcr:childVersionHistory"").getValue().getString();
                        Node actualNode = session.getNodeByUUID(uuid);
                        String name = actualNode.getName();
                        actualNode = session.getNodeByUUID(name);

                        return actualNode;
                }

                return node;
        }

 AND modified the following to call the above method


        public Object getObject(Session session, Class clazz, String path)
        {
                try {
                        if (!session.itemExists(path)) {

0,"Make DirectoryTaxonomyWriter's indexWriter member privateDirectoryTaxonomyWriter has a protected indexWriter member. As far as I can tell, for two reasons:

# protected openIndexWriter method which lets you open your own IW (e.g. with a custom IndexWriterConfig).
# protected closeIndexWriter which is a hook for letting you close the IW you opened in the previous one.

The fixes are trivial IMO:
# Modify the method to return IW, and have the calling code set DTW's indexWriter member
# Eliminate closeIW. DTW already has a protected closeResources() which lets you clean other resources you've allocated, so I think that's enough.

I'll post a patch shortly."
0,"Consolidate Lucene's QueryParsers into a moduleLucene has a lot of QueryParsers and we should have them all in a single consistent place.  

The following are QueryParsers I can find that warrant moving to the new module:

- Lucene Core's QueryParser
- AnalyzingQueryParser
- ComplexPhraseQueryParser
- ExtendableQueryParser
- Surround's QueryParser
- PrecedenceQueryParser
- StandardQueryParser
- XML-Query-Parser's CoreParser

All seem to do a good job at their kind of parsing with extensive tests.

One challenge of consolidating these is that many tests use Lucene Core's QueryParser.  One option is to just replicate this class in src/test and call it TestingQueryParser.  Another option is to convert all tests over to programmatically building their queries (seems like alot of work)."
1,"ChangeLog serialization causes cache inconsistenciesThe ordering of actions is taken into account when a ChangeLog is built through session manipulations (see, for instance,  ChangeLog.deleted(ItemState state)). When it is serialized in ClusterNode.write(Record record, ChangeLog changeLog, EventStateCollection esc), however, this implicit ordering might be changed. As a consequence,  the deserialization in ClusterNode.consume(Record record) might produce a different ChangeLog with the effect that the local caches get out-of-sync with the persistent state of the repository.

The issue should be reproducable as follows:
- Setup a clustered environment with two Jackrabbit instances, say A and B.
- On instance A add a property ""P"" with value ""x"" to some node and save the session.
- On instance B read property ""P"" -> it will have value ""x"".
- On instance A delete property P and then add it again with value ""y"" and save the session.
- On instance B read property ""P"" -> it will still have value ""x"" after the cluster sync..."

0,"Improved XML export handlingAs mentioned in JCR-1574, the current XML export functionality is generating workarounds like the new PropertyWrapper class. I'd like to refactor and clean up the XML export stuff so that such workarounds wouldn't be needed.

An additional bonus would be to make both core and jcr2spi use the same XML export mechanism. For example the one in core already supports JSR 283 shareable nodes, but the one in jcr2spi does not."
0,"[PATCH] Clear ThreadLocal instances in close()As already found out in LUCENE-436, there seems to be a garbage collection problem with ThreadLocals at certain constellations, resulting in an OutOfMemoryError.
The resolution there was to remove the reference to the ThreadLocal value when calling the close() method of the affected classes (see FieldsReader and TermInfosReader).
For Java < 5.0, this can effectively be done by calling threadLocal.set(null); for Java >= 5.0, we would call threadLocal.remove()

Analogously, this should be done in *any* class which creates ThreadLocal values

Right now, two classes of the core API make use of ThreadLocals, but do not properly remove their references to the ThreadLocal value
1. org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentReader
2. org.apache.lucene.analysis.Analyzer

For SegmentReader, I have attached a simple patch.
For Analyzer, there currently is no patch because Analyzer does not provide a close() method (future to-do?)

1,"JCA Concurrent Modification Exception when JCAManagedConnection.cleanup() calledThe JCAManagedConnection.closeHandles() method causes a ConcurrentModificationException if the handles list is not empty.
This is caused by modification of the handles list by removeHandle(), while closeHandles() is iterating over the list.

Under SunOne AppServer 7 this can be caused simply by not closing the Session handle before the transaction commits.

It is probably not even necessary to send connectionClosed events during cleanup().  According to the API for connectionClosed, the event indicates that an application component has closed  the connection handle.  cleanup() is a container initiated action, and so the connectionClosed event is not applicable.

0,"User-defined ProtocolSocketFactory for secure connection through proxyI use a custom socket implementation with HttpClient, and am having problems 
getting secure connections through a proxy working.

HttpClient requires that my SecureProtocolSocketFactory be able to create a 
secure socket layered over an existing insecure socket, but does not specify 
how that insecure socket is created. Currently, for secure proxied 
connections, the insecure connection is always created using a 
DefaultProtocolSocketFactory (HttpConnection.java, line 702). I wish to be 
able to override this behaviour, so that I can create the insecure socket 
using my own custom implementation.

The problem with the default behaviour is that my custom socket implementation 
is written in C++ using JNI, and the SSL implementation is handled at the 
native level. Hence, layering over an existing JDK socket will not work.

My proposed solution is to add an HTTP connection parameter to specify the

1,"Several Codecs use the same files - PerFieldCodecWrapper can not hold two codec using the same filesCurrently we have a rather simple file naming scheme which prevents us from using more than one codec in a segment that relies on the same file.  For instance pulsing and standard codec can not be used together since they both need the .frq .tii .tis etc. To make this work we either need to write distinct per codec files or set a per field / codec file ID. While the first solution seems to be quiet verbose the second one seems to be more flexible too.

One possibility to do that would be to assign a unique id to each SegmentsWriteState when opening the FieldsConsumer and write the IDs into the segments file to eventually load it once the segment is opened. Otherwise our PerFieldCodec feature will not be really flexible nor useful though.  "

In this case, this would produce tokens and payloads (assuming whitespace tokenization):
Token: the

But space is a reserved character to separate individual *products* and comments according to RFC 2616, section 14.43. Jakarta is not a product. At the same time we may want to drop the Jakarta name altogether.

0,"Add NumericField, make plain text numeric parsers public in FieldCache, move trie parsers to FieldCacheIn discussions about LUCENE-1673, Mike & me wanted to add a new NumericField to o.a.l.document specific for easy indexing. An alternative would be to add a NumericUtils.newXxxField() factory, that creates a preconfigured Field instance with norms and tf off, optionally a stored text (LUCENE-1699) and the TokenStream already initialized. On the other hand NumericUtils.newXxxSortField could be moved to NumericSortField.

I and Yonik tend to use the factory for both, Mike tends to create the new classes.

Also the parsers for string-formatted numerics are not public in FieldCache. As the new SortField API (LUCENE-1478) makes it possible to support a parser in SortField instantiation, it would be good to have the static parsers in FieldCache public available. SortField would init its member variable to them (instead of NULL), so making code a lot easier (FieldComparator has this ugly null checks when retrieving values from the cache).

Moving the Trie parsers also as static instances into FieldCache would make the code cleaner and we would be able to hide the ""hack"" StopFillCacheException by making it private to FieldCache (currently its public because NumericUtils is in o.a.l.util)."

1,"Highlight fragment does not extend to maxDocCharsToAnalyzeThe current highlighter code checks whether the total length of the text to highlight is strictly smaller than maxDocCharsToAnalyze before adding any text remaining after the last token to the fragment. This means that if maxDocCharsToAnalyse is set to exactly the length of the text and the last token of the text is the term to highlight and is followed by non-token text, this non-token text will not be highlighted.

For example, consider the phrase ""this is a text with searchterm in it"". ""In"" and ""it"" are not tokenized because they're stopwords. Setting maxDocCharsToAnalyze to 36 (the length of the sentence) and searching for ""searchterm"" gives a fragment ending in ""searchterm"". The expected behaviour is to have ""in it"" at the end of the fragment, since maxDocCharsToAnalyse explicitely states that the whole phrase should be considered."

1,"HostConfiguration socketFactory is ignoredHostConfiguration doesn't use its host.protocol to execute an HttpMethod with an absolute URL.  It should, if the Protocol's scheme is the same as the method's URL scheme.

This bug makes it difficult to integrate a specialized SSL connection algorithm (in a SecureProtocolSocketFactory) with a module implemented on top of HttpClient.  The latter module must not execute methods with absolute URLs.  Of course, this is difficult when one doesn't control that module.  For example, I recently tried to integrate SSL certificate-based client authentication with XFire.  XFire provides a reasonable API for replacing its HttpClient, but one must hack its source code to prevent it from executing methods with absolute URLs.

Protocol.registerProtocol is a possible answer, but it can't support two or more SSL connection algorithms for one HTTPS host and port."

If the signature would be ""LuceneQueryFactoryImpl#create(FullTextSearchImpl fts, Value searchExpression)"" we could visit the StaticOperand in the ConstraintBuilder and then modify the FullTextSearchImpl constructor accordingly, but this would imply that LuceneQueryFactory interface would need to be change accordingly and I don't know what that would mean."

1,JCARepositoryManager does not close InputStreamJCR-3129 opened a already closed issue [JCR-1667]
1,"checkIfNodeLocked()  in jcr mapping layer  does not behave properly when open scoped locks are usedI am planning to use open-scoped lock.  For which , I need to persist the locktoken along with the node  so that it can be used by another session for unlocking.Tested with Jackrabbit RMI client and it works fine.

But I am using jcr-mapping layer to achieve the above in my project.Here I want that  as soon as a node is checked out, it gets locked by the session and the lock is stored in ""lockToken"" property of node ""Document"". For that I need to update the Document node after locking .

*public void checkout(String path)throws CMSException {
       pm = getPersistenceManager();
        try{
           pm.checkout(path);*
*            String lockToken = pm.lock(path,true,false);   **        
    Document doc = this.getDocument(path);**           
  doc.setLockToken(lockToken);     //for persisting lockToken
           doc.update();
        }catch(LockedException le){
          System.out.println(le.getLockedNodePath() + ""is locked by"" + le.getLockOwner());         }catch(Exception e){
            throw new CMSException(e.getMessage(),e.getCause());
        }
   }*


Here doc.update() fails with Locked Exception.  The problem here is PersistenceManagerImpl has a method checkIfNodeLocked(path)  which returns LockException if node is locked. This method is checked before every update/insert. So, I am not able to update a locked node. I need to persist the locktoken in the node . What is the reason of checking  for a lock before saving ? Ideally , it should throw error only if node is locked and session does not hold the lockToken .

If the session who has locked the node tries to save the node without unlocking, it should be allowed .

p.s.
I am able to achieve the above by simple Jackrabbit RMI client.

0,"JcrUtils.getRepository(...) for simple repository accessAs discussed on the mailing list, it would be nice to have a trivially simple way (one line of code) to connect to a repository. The RepositoryFactory interface in JCR 2.0 defines a way for clients to get a repository reference without a direct implementation dependency, but a client still needs extra code to handle the Service Provider lookup and the iteration through all the available repository factories.

To simplify client code I'd like to introduce a JcrUtils.getRepository(Map<String, String>) method that takes care of the tasks mentioned above:

    Map<String, String> parameters = ...; // repository settings
    Repository repository = JcrUtils.getRepository(parameters);

As a further simplification, I'd also like to introduce a JcrUtils.getRepository(String) method that builds the parameter map based on a given ""repository URI"".

    Repository repository = JcrUtils.getRepository(""file:///path/to/repository"");

    Repository repository = JcrUtils.getRepository(""http://localhost:8080/server"");

The result is that it is now impossible to import a string with _x0020_ in it, because it gets translated in a space. The simple solution would be to just turn off the declodeBlanks option, but I'm not sure why it was added in the first place. Another option would be to use real encoding instead of a replace like the o.a.j.util.ISO9075.

0,"Some house cleaning in addIndexes*Today, the use of addIndexes and addIndexesNoOptimize is confusing - 
especially on when to invoke each. Also, addIndexes calls optimize() in 
the beginning, but only on the target index. It also includes the 
following jdoc statement, which from how I understand the code, is 
wrong: _After this completes, the index is optimized._ -- optimize() is 
called in the beginning and not in the end. 

On the other hand, addIndexesNoOptimize does not call optimize(), and 
relies on the MergeScheduler and MergePolicy to handle the merges. 

After a short discussion about that on the list (Thanks Mike for the 
clarifications!) I understand that there are really two core differences 
between the two: 
* addIndexes supports IndexReader extensions
* addIndexesNoOptimize performs better

This issue proposes the following:
# Clear up the documentation of each, spelling out the pros/cons of 
  calling them clearly in the javadocs.
# Rename addIndexesNoOptimize to addIndexes
# Remove optimize() call from addIndexes(IndexReader...)
# Document that clearly in both, w/ a recommendation to call optimize() 
  before on any of the Directories/Indexes if it's a concern. 

That way, we maintain all the flexibility in the API - 
addIndexes(IndexReader...) allows for using IR extensions, 
addIndexes(Directory...) is considered more efficient, by allowing the 
merges to happen concurrently (depending on MS) and also factors in the 
MP. So unless you have an IR extension, addDirectories is really the one 
you should be using. And you have the freedom to call optimize() before 
each if you care about it, or don't if you don't care. Either way, 
incurring the cost of optimize() is entirely in the user's hands. 

BTW, addIndexes(IndexReader...) does not use neither the MergeScheduler 
nor MergePolicy, but rather call SegmentMerger directly. This might be 
another place for improvement. I'll look into it, and if it's not too 
complicated, I may cover it by this issue as well. If you have any hints 
that can give me a good head start on that, please don't be shy :). "

0,"Reintroduce NamespaceStoragehi jukka

i open this issue as a reminder of our recent discussion in basel:

we decided that you will 
- reintroduce the NamespaceStorage you recently removed from jcr2spi
- reintroduce a namespace cache in jcr2spi (but using a simple map instead of NamespaceCache object)

in addition we agreed that we want to share the NamespaceRegistryImpl between jcr2spi and jackrabbit-core
and you volenteered to provide a patch for that.

thanks in advance

0,"TCK: RestoreTest.testRestoreLabelAccording to tobi the jackrabbit implementation of 'Node.restoreByLabel' is an interpretation of the
specification regarding the restore behaviour of versionable child nodes. while that interpetration might
be legal unless the specification is violated, i would argue that the TCK should not test the interpretation.

therefore i suggest to modify

org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.version.RestoreTest.testRestoreLabel

by skipping line 334 - 345 in order to limit the test case to the behaviour that is defined by the specification.

angela

ps: the mentioned test is also executed within the scope of WorkspaceRestoreTest because the latter  extends RestoreTest.... that's misleading."

0,"Avoidable synchronization bottleneck in MatchAlldocsQuery$MatchAllScorerThe isDeleted() method on IndexReader has been mentioned a number of times as a potential synchronization bottleneck. However, the reason this  bottleneck occurs is actually at a higher level that wasn't focused on (at least in the threads I read).

In every case I saw where a stack trace was provided to show the lock/block, higher in the stack you see the MatchAllScorer.next() method. In Solr paricularly, this scorer is used for ""NOT"" queries. We saw incredibly poor performance (order of magnitude) on our load tests for NOT queries, due to this bottleneck. The problem is that every single document is run through this isDeleted() method, which is synchronized. Having an optimized index exacerbates this issues, as there is only a single SegmentReader to synchronize on, causing a major thread pileup waiting for the lock.

By simply having the MatchAllScorer see if there have been any deletions in the reader, much of this can be avoided. Especially in a read-only environment for production where you have slaves doing all the high load searching.

I modified line 67 in the MatchAllDocsQuery
FROM:
  if (!reader.isDeleted(id)) {
TO:
  if (!reader.hasDeletions() || !reader.isDeleted(id)) {

In our micro load test for NOT queries only, this was a major performance improvement.  We also got the same query results. I don't believe this will improve the situation for indexes that have deletions. 

Please consider making this adjustment for a future bug fix release.

0,"Fix FuzzyQuery's defaults, so its fast.We worked a lot on FuzzyQuery, but you need to be a rocket scientist to ensure good results.

The main problem is that the default distance is 0.5f, which doesn't take into account the length of the string.
To add insult to injury, the default number of expansions is 1024 (traditionally from BooleanQuery maxClauseCount)

I propose:
* The syntax of FuzzyQuery is enhanced, so that you can specify raw edits too: such as foobar~2 (all terms within 2 levenshtein edits of foobar). Previously if you specified any amount >=1, you got IllegalArgumentException, so this won't break anyone. You can still use foobar~0.5, and it works just as before
* The default for minimumSimilarity then becomes LevenshteinAutomata.MAXIMUM_SUPPORTED_DISTANCE, which is 2. This way if you just do foobar~, its always fast.
* The size of the priority queue is reduced by default from 1024 to a much more reasonable value: 50. This is what FuzzyLikeThis uses.

I think its best to just change the defaults for this query, since it was so aweful before. We can add notes in migrate.txt that if you care about using the old values, then you should provide them explicitly, and you will get the same results!

that should catch SocketTimeoutException instead.  For example, from 
HttpConnection:

        if (isOpen) {
            // the connection is open, but now we have to see if we can

                            isStale = true;

            } catch (InterruptedIOException e) {
                // aha - the connection is NOT stale - continue on!

Here the catch of InterruptedIOException is intended to happen when 
inputStream.read() terminates due to the socket.setSoTimeout() time being 
reached.  However, it could also occur because Thread.interrupt() has been 
called, in which case ""continue on"" is not what should happen, instead, the 
request should terminate.

There are legitimate reasons why someone might want to interrupt the 
httpclient code, for example, httpclient does not provide a hard timeout on 
the total length of time a request may take, including connecting, sending 
the request, and receiving the complete response, so to enforce a hard 
timeout it is necessary to run the request in a worker thread and interrupt 
it if it hasn't completed before the timeout expires (the technique used in 
your TimeoutController class).

Note that SocketTimeoutException was added in 1.4.  For compatibility with 
older jdk versions, the code can catch InterruptedIOException and use 
getClass() to see whether it is a SocketTimeoutException.

There are probably other places in the code where InterruptedIOException is 
caught and interpreted as a socket timeout, and where Thread.interrupt() 
will not have the proper effect of causing the request to terminate ASAP, 
but I'm not familiar enough with the code to find them all."

1,"Adding empty ParallelReader indexes to an IndexWriter may cause ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or NoSuchElementExceptionHi,
I recently stumbled upon this:

It is possible (and perfectly legal) to add empty indexes (IndexReaders) to an IndexWriter. However, when using ParallelReaders in this context, in two situations RuntimeExceptions may occur for no good reason.

Condition 1:
The indexes within the ParallelReader are just empty.

When adding them to the IndexWriter, we get a java.util.NoSuchElementException triggered by ParallelTermEnum's constructor. The reason for that is the TreeMap#firstKey() method which was assumed to return null if there is no entry (which is not true, apparently -- it only returns null if the first key in the Map is null).


Condition 2 (Assuming the aforementioned bug is fixed):
The indexes within the ParallelReader originally contained one or more fields with TermVectors, but all documents have been marked as deleted.

When adding the indexes to the IndexWriter, we get a java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException triggered by TermVectorsWriter#addAllDocVectors. The reason here is that TermVectorsWriter assumes that if the index is marked to have TermVectors, at least one field actually exists for that. This unfortunately is not true, either.

Patches and a testcase demonstrating the two bugs are provided.

Cheers,
Christian"

0,"AttributeSource/TokenStream API improvementsThis patch makes the following improvements to AttributeSource and
TokenStream/Filter:

- introduces interfaces for all Attributes. The corresponding
  implementations have the postfix 'Impl', e.g. TermAttribute and
  TermAttributeImpl. AttributeSource now has a factory for creating
  the Attribute instances; the default implementation looks for
  implementing classes with the postfix 'Impl'. Token now implements
  all 6 TokenAttribute interfaces.

- new method added to AttributeSource:
  addAttributeImpl(AttributeImpl). Using reflection it walks up in the
  class hierarchy of the passed in object and finds all interfaces
  that the class or superclasses implement and that extend the
  Attribute interface. It then adds the interface->instance mappings
  to the attribute map for each of the found interfaces.

- removes the set/getUseNewAPI() methods (including the standard
  ones). Instead it is now enough to only implement the new API,
  if one old TokenStream implements still the old API (next()/next(Token)),
  it is wrapped automatically. The delegation path is determined via
  reflection (the patch determines, which of the three methods was
  overridden).

- Token is no longer deprecated, instead it implements all 6 standard
  token interfaces (see above). The wrapper for next() and next(Token)
  uses this, to automatically map all attribute interfaces to one
  TokenWrapper instance (implementing all 6 interfaces), that contains
  a Token instance. next() and next(Token) exchange the inner Token
  instance as needed. For the new incrementToken(), only one
  TokenWrapper instance is visible, delegating to the currect reusable
  Token. This API also preserves custom Token subclasses, that maybe
  created by very special token streams (see example in Backwards-Test).

- AttributeImpl now has a default implementation of toString that uses
  reflection to print out the values of the attributes in a default
  formatting. This makes it a bit easier to implement AttributeImpl,
  because toString() was declared abstract before.

- Cloning is now done much more efficiently in
  captureState. The method figures out which unique AttributeImpl
  instances are contained as values in the attributes map, because
  those are the ones that need to be cloned. It creates a single
  linked list that supports deep cloning (in the inner class
  AttributeSource.State). AttributeSource keeps track of when this
  state changes, i.e. whenever new attributes are added to the
  AttributeSource. Only in that case will captureState recompute the
  state, otherwise it will simply clone the precomputed state and
  return the clone. restoreState(AttributeSource.State) walks the
  linked list and uses the copyTo() method of AttributeImpl to copy
  all values over into the attribute that the source stream
  (e.g. SinkTokenizer) uses. 

- Tee- and SinkTokenizer were deprecated, because they use
Token instances for caching. This is not compatible to the new API
using AttributeSource.State objects. You can still use the old
deprecated ones, but new features provided by new Attribute types
may get lost in the chain. A replacement is a new TeeSinkTokenFilter,
which has a factory to create new Sink instances, that have compatible
attributes. Sink instances created by one Tee can also be added to
another Tee, as long as the attribute implementations are compatible
(it is not possible to add a sink from a tee using one Token instance
to a tee using the six separate attribute impls). In this case UOE is thrown.

The cloning performance can be greatly improved if not multiple
AttributeImpl instances are used in one TokenStream. A user can
e.g. simply add a Token instance to the stream instead of the individual
attributes. Or the user could implement a subclass of AttributeImpl that
implements exactly the Attribute interfaces needed. I think this
should be considered an expert API (addAttributeImpl), as this manual
optimization is only needed if cloning performance is crucial. I ran
some quick performance tests using Tee/Sink tokenizers (which do
cloning) and the performance was roughly 20% faster with the new
API. I'll run some more performance tests and post more numbers then.

Note also that when we add serialization to the Attributes, e.g. for
supporting storing serialized TokenStreams in the index, then the
serialization should benefit even significantly more from the new API
than cloning. 

This issue contains one backwards-compatibility break:
TokenStreams/Filters/Tokenizers should normally be final
(see LUCENE-1753 for the explaination). Some of these core classes are 
not final and so one could override the next() or next(Token) methods.
In this case, the backwards-wrapper would automatically use
incrementToken(), because it is implemented, so the overridden
method is never called. To prevent users from errors not visible
during compilation or testing (the streams just behave wrong),
this patch makes all implementation methods final
(next(), next(Token), incrementToken()), whenever the class
itsself is not final. This is a BW break, but users will clearly see,
that they have done something unsupoorted and should better
create a custom TokenFilter with their additional implementation
(instead of extending a core implementation).

For further changing contrib token streams the following procedere should be used:

    *  rewrite and replace next(Token)/next() implementations by new API
    * if the class is final, no next(Token)/next() methods needed (must be removed!!!)
    * if the class is non-final add the following methods to the class:

1,"StackOverflowError in HttpConnectionWhen the HttpConnection#WrappedOutputStream.flush () encounters IOException 
druign write, it is calling HttpConnection.close which calls 
HttpConnection.closeSocketAndStreams and which eventually calls 
HttpConnection#WrappedOutputStream.flush again.  The circular calls will cause 
StackOverflowError.

I run into this accidentally when I was trying to extend HttpConnection.  But 
looking through the code, I believe any IOException may cause the same

1,"[PATCH] TermInfosReader, SegmentTermEnum Out Of Memory ExceptionWe've been experiencing terrible memory problems on our production search server, running lucene (1.4.3).

Our live app regularly opens new indexes and, in doing so, releases old IndexReaders for garbage collection.

But...there appears to be a memory leak in org.apache.lucene.index.TermInfosReader.java.
Under certain conditions (possibly related to JVM version, although I've personally observed it under both linux JVM 1.4.2_06, and 1.5.0_03, and SUNOS JVM 1.4.1) the ThreadLocal member variable, ""enumerators"" doesn't get garbage-collected when the TermInfosReader object is gc-ed.

Looking at the code in TermInfosReader.java, there's no reason why it _shouldn't_ be gc-ed, so I can only presume (and I've seen this suggested elsewhere) that there could be a bug in the garbage collector of some JVMs.

I've seen this problem briefly discussed; in particular at the following URL:
  http://java2.5341.com/msg/85821.html
The patch that Doug recommended, which is included in lucene-1.4.3 doesn't work in our particular circumstances. Doug's patch only clears the ThreadLocal variable for the thread running the finalizer (my knowledge of java breaks down here - I'm not sure which thread actually runs the finalizer). In our situation, the TermInfosReader is (potentially) used by more than one thread, meaning that Doug's patch _doesn't_ allow the affected JVMs to correctly collect garbage.

So...I've devised a simple patch which, from my observations on linux JVMs 1.4.2_06, and 1.5.0_03, fixes this problem.

1,"MultiFieldQueryParser ignores slop parameterMultiFieldQueryParser.getFieldQuery(String, String, int) calls super.getFieldQuery(String, String), thus obliterating any slop parameter present in the query.

It should probably be changed to call super.getFieldQuery(String, String, int), except doing only that will result in a recursive loop which is a side-effect of what may be a deeper problem in MultiFieldQueryParser -- getFieldQuery(String, String, int) is documented as delegating to getFieldQuery(String, String), yet what it actually does is the exact opposite.  This also causes problems for subclasses which need to override getFieldQuery(String, String) to provide different behaviour.

0,"add LuceneTestCase.rarely()/LuceneTestCase.atLeast()in LUCENE-3175, the tests were sped up a lot by using reasonable number of iterations normally, but cranking up for NIGHTLY.
we also do crazy things more 'rarely' for normal builds (e.g. simpletext, payloads, crazy merge params, etc)
also, we found some bugs by doing this, because in general our parameters are too fixed.

however, it made the code look messy... I propose some new methods:
instead of some crazy code in your test like:
{code}
int numdocs = (TEST_NIGHTLY ? 1000 : 100) * RANDOM_MULTIPLIER;
{code}

you use:
{code}
int numdocs = atLeast(100);
{code}

this will apply the multiplier, also factor in nightly, and finally add some random fudge... so e.g. in local runs its sometimes 127 docs, sometimes 113 docs, etc.

additionally instead of code like:
{code}
if ((TEST_NIGHTLY && random.nextBoolean()) || (random.nextInt(20) == 17)) {
{code}

you do
{code}
if (rarely()) {
{code}

which applies NIGHTLY and also the multiplier (logarithmic growth).

0,"Regex support and beyond in JavaCC QueryParserSince the early days the standard query parser was limited to the queries living in core, adding other queries or extending the parser in any way always forced people to change the grammar file and regenerate. Even if you change the grammar you have to be extremely careful how you modify the parser so that other parts of the standard parser are affected by customisation changes. Eventually you had to live with all the limitation the current parser has like tokenizing on whitespaces before a tokenizer / analyzer has the chance to look at the tokens. 
I was thinking about how to overcome the limitation and add regex support to the query parser without introducing any dependency to core. I added a new special character that basically prevents the parser from interpreting any of the characters enclosed in the new special characters. I choose the forward slash  '/' as the delimiter so that everything in between two forward slashes is basically escaped and ignored by the parser. All chars embedded within forward slashes are treated as one token even if it contains other special chars like * []?{} or whitespaces. This token is subsequently passed to a pluggable ""parser extension"" with builds a query from the embedded string. I do not interpret the embedded string in any way but leave all the subsequent work to the parser extension. Such an extension could be another full featured query parser itself or simply a ctor call for regex query. The interface remains quiet simple but makes the parser extendible in an easy way compared to modifying the javaCC sources.

The downsides of this patch is clearly that I introduce a new special char into the syntax but I guess that would not be that much of a deal as it is reflected in the escape method though. It would truly be nice to have more than once extension an have this even more flexible so treat this patch as a kickoff though.

Another way of solving the problem with RegexQuery would be to move the JDK version of regex into the core and simply have another method like:
{code}
protected Query newRegexQuery(Term t) {
  ... 
}
{code}

which I would like better as it would be more consistent with the idea of the query parser to be a very strict and defined parser.

I will upload a patch in a second which implements the extension based approach I guess I will add a second patch with regex in core soon too.

1,"Event filtering by path not working as specifiedWhen filtering node events by path, the event filter doesn't compare using the ""associated parent path"", see JSR-170, 8.3.3:

""The set of events can be filtered by specifying restrictions based on characteristics of the associated parent node of the event. The associated parent node of an event is the parent node of the item at (or formerly at) the path returned by Event.getPath. The following restrictions are available:

• absPath, isDeep: Only events whose associated parent node is at absPath (or within its subtree, if isDeep is true) will be received. It is permissible to register a listener for a path where no node currently exists.""

(for property events, filtering is correct)

To fix this, the special handling of node events in EventFilter.blocks() simply needs to be removed.

0,"Simplify NRTManagerNRTManager is hairy now, because the applyDeletes is separately passed
to ctor, passed to maybeReopen, passed to getSearcherManager, etc.

I think, instead, you should pass it only to the ctor, and if you have
some cases needing deletes and others not then you can make two
NRTManagers.  This should be no less efficient than we have today,
just simpler.

I think it will also enable NRTManager to subclass ThingyManager

0,"Provide limit on phrase analysis in FastVectorHighlighterWith larger documents, FVH can spend a lot of time trying to find the best-scoring snippet as it examines every possible phrase formed from matching terms in the document.  If one is willing to accept
less-than-perfect scoring by limiting the number of phrases that are examined, substantial speedups are possible.  This is analogous to the Highlighter limit on the number of characters to analyze.

The patch includes an artifical test case that shows > 1000x speedup.  In a more normal test environment, with English documents and random queries, I am seeing speedups of around 3-10x when setting phraseLimit=1, which has the effect of selecting the first possible snippet in the document.  Most of our sites operate in this way (just show the first snippet), so this would be a big win for us.

With phraseLimit = -1, you get the existing FVH behavior. At larger values of phraseLimit, you may not get substantial speedup in the normal case, but you do get the benefit of protection against blow-up in pathological cases.

1,"DavMethodBase#getResponseException fails if the body is not (valid) XMLI have a set up that uses the JCR Webdav Server from a custom remote client.
I've noticed one thing, anytime I request a node that doesn't exist the error that comes back from the server is as follows:

[Fatal Error] :1:941: The element type ""HR"" must be terminated by the matching end-tag ""</HR>"".
javax.jcr.RepositoryException: The element type ""HR"" must be terminated by the matching end-tag ""</HR>"".: The element type ""HR"" must be terminated by the matching end-tag ""</HR>"".

Doesn't really make sense, but that is OK, I can handle that.

My problem:
I have a partially populated repository that at the root has a few nodes like
/edu/....
/com/ibm/..

So, I want to create a few nodes of type nt:folder under

com/myCompany/folder1

I have no problem creating them, but since ""com"" already exists I end up with
com[2]/myCompany/folder1.

So, I went ahead and used the parentNode.hasNode(""folderName"") method.

This method returns true for the ""com"" portion, but when I test for the ""myCompany"" folder which should return false I get the error response shown above from the server.

The webdav request looks as follows:
PROPFIND /jackrabbit/server/default/jcr%3aroot/com/myCompany

The snippet of code looks as follows:
  private Node createFolders (Session session, Node parentNode, List <String> folders)
	  throws RepositoryException {
    Node folderNode = null;
    for (String folder : folders) {
	if (parentNode.hasNode(folder))

1,"Versioning fixup leaves persistence in a state where the node can't be made versionable againJackrabbit's version recovery mode (org.apache.jackrabbit.version.recovery system property) disconnects all version histories that expose problems that manifest in unexpected exceptions being thrown. ""disconnects"" means removing the properties defined for mix:versionable and removing the mixin type. The actual versioning related nodes remain in place.

The problem: when re-adding mix:versionable, ItemSaveOperation.initVersionHistories tries to create the new version history in the same location (the path being derived from the versionable node's identifier), and consequently fails because of the broken underlying storage.

This gives greatly improved performance, but note it has some minor breaks to snowball internals:
* Among.s becomes a char[] instead of a string
* SnowballProgram.current becomes a char[] instead of a StringBuilder
* SnowballProgram.eq_s(int, String) becomes eq_s(int, CharSequence), so that eq_v(StringBuilder) doesnt need to create an extra string.
* same as the above with eq_s_b and eq_v_b
* replace_s(int, int, String) becomes replace_s(int, int, CharSequence), so that StringBuilder-based slice and insertion methods don't need to create an extra string.

0,"NetscapeDraftSpec is too strict about cookie expires date formatThe Netscape Draft specification (http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html) specifies clearly that the date format for Set-Cookie expires is ""Wdy, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT"". But on the other hand, in the examples section of the same document, the only example header that contains ""Expires"" is the following:

Set-Cookie: CUSTOMER=WILE_E_COYOTE; path=/; expires=Wednesday, 09-Nov-99 23:12:40 GMT

Note that the weekday is fully spelled out and that the year is written as two digits only. I would say that the specification therefore makes the 2 or 4 digit year optional. I think NetscapeDraftSpec should reflect this. An example of a product that uses the 2 digit version is jetty 6 and 7. When using httpclient 4 talking to a jetty server, any Set-Cookie headers for persistent cookies will be interpreted as a 4 digit year in the date and the cookie will immediately be disregarded as expired by some 2,000 years or so. Httpclient 3 on the other hand had no problem understanding the persistent cookies from jetty. I filed a bug report https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=304698 on jetty to change their date format, but on the other hand I also think httpclient 4 is too strict about the date format when even the original specification uses two alternatives.

Workaround is easy by setting CookieSpecPNames.DATE_PATTERNS, but I really think that projects like jetty and httpclient should be compatible by default. Also, since the date format used by jetty is parsable but misinterpreted and disregarded by httpclient makes it especially hard to detect the first time on encounters the problem."

0,"Multiple DIGEST authentication attempts with same credentialsHttpMethodBase's processAuthenticationResponse uses a set of realms to which
attempts to authenticate have already been made. The elements of the set are a
concatenation of the requested path and the value of the Authentication response

For digest authentication this response header contains a nonce value, which is
uniquely generated by the server each time a 401 response is made. This makes it
impossible to recognize that authentication against this realm has been
attempted before and so all 100 attempts are made before returning. The nonce

0,"RepositoryStub implementation in jackrabbit-coreCurrently setting up a Jackrabbit repository for use with the TCK is a relatively complex operation with a large repositoryStubImpl.properties file and lots of specially crafted test content and settings to worry about. This makes it hard to set up new TCK test instances with the various JCR and SPI layers we now have.

To simplify things I'd like to introduce a RepositoryStubImpl class and related configuration files inside src/main/java in jackrabbit-core."
1,"When creating multiple repository instances pointing to the same home, opening a second session will remove the .lock fileThe following test case can be used to reproduce the bug:
Repository repo1 = new TransientRepository(repoConfig);
Session session1_1 = repo1.login(...);
Session session2_2 = repo1.login(...);
Repository repo2 = new TransientRepository(repoConfig); // Will not fail (expected)
Session session2_1 = repo2.login(...); // Will fail with javax.jcr.RepositoryException: The repository home /tmp/_repository appears to be already locked by the current process (expected)
Session session2_2 = repo2.login(...); // Will work!
Repository repo3 = new TransientRepository(repoConfig); // Will not fail either (expected)
Session session3_1 = repo3.login(...); // Will fail with javax.jcr.RepositoryException: The repository home /tmp/_repository appears to be already locked by the current process (expected)
Session session3_2 = repo3.login(...); // Will fail with javax.jcr.RepositoryException: Directory was previously created with a different LockFactory instance

Open the first session in repo2 will fails but will also remove the .lock file, thus the second
session will succeed and may corrupt the repository because there are multiple session
opened from multiple repository.
The same behaviour occurs for repo3, the .lock file is removed but it is a slightly different case
as a new exception will be thrown while creating the Lucene index.

This is a clearly a twisted case as repositories pointing to the same home must not be created
simultaneously but i think that it must be more robust to prevent data corruption.

I reproduce the bug on JR 1.4.7 and 1.5.3 but i think it affects at least all versions of JR < 1.5.3."

You should never supply a Reader to any XML api, unless you have internal character data (e.g. created programmatically). Also you should supply a system id, as resolving external entities does not work. The loader from files is much more broken, it always open the file as a Reader and then passes it to InputSource. Instead it should point filename directly to InputSource.

This issue will fix it in trunk and use InputSource in Solr, but will still supply the Reader possibility in previous versions (deprecated)."

1,"Request with two forward slashes for path failsThe following code demonstrates the problem:
        DefaultHttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();

When a request is made, the DefaultRequestDirector invokes rewriteRequestURI(). I don't fully understand why this method does what it does. For a non-proxied request, it attempts to render the URI to a relative URI. In doing so, it tries to create a relative URI whose content is ""//"". Per RFC 2396 section 5 (Relative URI References), a relative URI that begins with ""//"" is a network-path reference, and the ""//"" must be immediately followed by an authority. Therefore, while ""http://www.google.com//"" is a valid absolute URI, ""//"" is not a valid relative one. The resulting exception:

0,"Add reflection API to AttributeSource/AttributeImplAttributeSource/TokenStream inspection in Solr needs to have some insight into the contents of AttributeImpls. As LUCENE-2302 has some problems with toString() [which is not structured and conflicts with CharSequence's definition for CharTermAttribute], I propose an simple API that get a default implementation in AttributeImpl (just like toString() current):

- Iterator<Map.Entry<String,?>> AttributeImpl.contentsIterator() returns an iterator (for most attributes its a singleton) of a key-value pair, e.g. ""term""->""foobar"",""startOffset""->Integer.valueOf(0),...
- AttributeSource gets the same method, it just concat the iterators of each getAttributeImplsIterator() AttributeImpl

No backwards problems occur, as the default toString() method will work like before (it just gets iterator and lists), but we simply remove the documentation for the format. (Char)TermAttribute gets a special impl fo toString() according to CharSequence and a corresponding iterator.

I also want to remove the abstract hashCode() and equals() methods from AttributeImpl, as they are not needed and just create work for the implementor."
1,"Sloppy Phrase Scorer matches the doc ""A B C D E"" for query = ""B C B""~2This is an extension of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-697

In addition to abnormalities Yonik pointed out in 697, there seem to be other issues with slopy phrase search and scoring.

1) A phrase with a repeated word would be detected in a document although it is not there.
I.e. document = A B D C E , query = ""B C B"" would not find this document (as expected), but query ""B C B""~2 would find it. 
I think that no matter how large the slop is, this document should not be a match.

2) A document containing both orders of a query, symmetrically, would score differently for the queru and for its reveresed form.
I.e. document = A B C B A would score differently for queries ""B C""~2 and ""C B""~2, although it is symmetric to both.

I will attach test cases that show both these problems and the one reported by Yonik in 697. "
0,"Omit default BatchReadConfig in Spi2davexRepositoryServiceFactoryi'd like to remove the default batchread configuration created in Spi2davexRepositoryServiceFactory (ll 79) and instead pass

1,"Explicit VirtualHosts Can Cause Issues On RedirectsIf you set an explicit virtual host then a getmethod may get stuck in a redirect
loop (up to maxRedirects).

e.g. execute a get on www.google.com (with a www.google.com virtualhost).  That
redirects to www.google.co.nz (at least if you come from an NZ IP).  The current
httpclient behavior is to then connect to www.google.co.nz but pass through,
with the request, ""Host: www.google.com"".  Google will then reply with another
www.google.co.nz redirect and the loop continues.

There are probably a few ways to work around this.  It seems reasonable to drop
an explicity set virtual host in the event a redirect redirects to a different
uri authority.  The following patch works for me:

With the default value of 10 for mergeFactor and 100 for minMergeDocs, as soon as 10 index directories exist with less or equal than 100 nodes they are merged into a single one. This process is then repeated by multiplying the minMergeDocs with the mergeFactor. Therefore the second round will merge 10 index directories with less or equal than 1000 nodes.

Because the above process is part of the regular workspace store operation an index merge with more than let's say 10'000 nodes can block the store operation for a couple of seconds. With the current synchronization scheme, all other threads are blocked from writing. This is not acceptable.

Index merging should run in a separate thread in the background.

The process needs to take care of the following:
- While merging indexes, deletes on those indexes must not get lost
- Switching between the indexes that are merged and the new index must be atomic
- Recovery if merging is interrupted, e.g. jackrabbit is shutdown"
0,"SnowballAnalyzer lacks a constructor that takes a Set of Stop WordsAs discussed on the java-user list, the SnowballAnalyzer has been updated to use a Set of stop words. However, there is no constructor which accepts a Set, there's only the original String[] one

This is an issue, because most of the common sources of stop words (eg StopAnalyzer) have deprecated their String[] stop word lists, and moved over to Sets (eg StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET). So, for now, you either have to use a deprecated field on StopAnalyzer, or manually turn the Set into an array so you can pass it to the SnowballAnalyzer

I am using httpclient 4.1. I had a problem with this fix. In DefaultRequestDirector.rewriteRequestURI method, for non-proxied URI and when it is a absolute URI, it will call the URIUtils.rewriteURI, which then take the ""RawPath"" from an uri and normalize it. So when I pass an uri, for example, http://www.whatever.com/1//3, it will automatically remove the extra slash and become http://www.whatever.com/1/3. I've got a REStful service to accept the uri (/{param1}/{param2}/{param3}) and it takes when there is an empty value past in. Now because of the auto slash removal, the ""3"" value shift left for a position and match to the {param2}. I wouldn't say the above solution is wrong, but I guess it should not change what value that user pass in."

1,"WorkspaceConfig.init() throws NullPointerException if Search configuration is missingWhen the search configuration is missing from the repository.xml configuration, the WorkspaceConfig.sc field is null and consequently the WorkspaceConfig.init() method throws a NullPointerException.

This is by itself a bug, especially since missing search configuration is perfectly ok resulting in Jackrabbit not building the search index (which is - believe it or - what really want).

On that matter, since the configuration file structure seems to be implied by the configuration framework but the DTD is inlined into the configuration file, the configuration framework should act very gracefully to missing or wrong or unexpected configuration elements. Thus, for example, if the file system configuration (WorkspaceConfig.fsc) would be missing, the WorkspaceConfig should probably hint at this point and not throw a NullPointerException without further explanations (of course throwing anything at all is still better than going wild)."

This issue is related to JCR-325, but there should be a lot easier fix for this special case."
0,"Disallow setBoost() on StringField, throw exception if boosts are set if norms are omittedOccasionally users are confused why index-time boosts are not applied to their norms-omitted fields.

This is because we silently discard the boost: there is no reason for this!

The most absurd part: in 4.0 you can make a StringField and call setBoost and nothing complains... (more reasons to remove StringField totally in my opinion)"
0,"[patch] better support gcj compilationThere are two methods in IndexReader.java called 'delete'. That is a reserved
keyword in C++ and these methods cause trouble for gcj which implements a clever
workaround in renaming them delete$ but the OS X dynamic linker doesn't pick-up
on it.
The attached patch renames delete(int) to deleteDocument(int) and delete(Term)
to deleteDocuments(Term) and deprecates the delete methods (as requested by Doug
Cutting)."

0,"LargeDocHighlighter - another span highlighter optimized for large documentsThe existing Highlighter API is rich and well designed, but the approach taken is not very efficient for large documents.

I believe that this is because the current Highlighter rebuilds the document by running through and scoring every every token in the tokenstream.

With a break in the current API, an alternate approach can be taken: rebuild the document by running through the query terms by using their offsets. The benefit is clear - a large doc will have a large tokenstream, but a query will likely be very small in comparison.

I expect this approach to be quite a bit faster for very large documents, while still supporting Phrase and Span queries.

First rough patch to follow shortly."
0,"Refactor the Mapper & DescriptotReader classesI would like to refactor the mappers and the descriptor readers  in order to : 
* Create an abstract mapper impl because both Mapper classes have a lot of code in common (AnnotedObjectMapper & DigesterMapperImpl). Only the readers are different. The Mappers can make exactly the same process. 
* The Mapper classes should not have the responsibility to create the jcr node types. This can be done outside the mapper and it should be an optional operation. There are certainly some use cases where node type creation is not necessary. Right now, the annotated object mapper creates jcr node types. "
0,"Cannot use Lucene in an unsigned applet due to Java security restrictionsA few of the Lucene source files call System.getProperty and perform a couple of
other operations within static initializers that assume full Java 2 permissions.
This prevents Lucene from being used from an unsigned applet embedded in a
browser page, since the default security permissions for an applet will prohibit
reading of most properties.

I would suggest wrapping the initialization of the properties in try/catch
blocks. This does mean that a couple properties would need to be made non-final,
and in some cases, getter and setter methods might be desirable to allow the
applet programmer to change the property values at runtime (some variables are
public static and could be changed directly without accessors).

This problem occurs with the shipping 1.4.3 version as well as the latest (as of
 07-apr-2005) source code fetched from CVS.

Currently, the files that are affected are org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter,
org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentReader, org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery,
and org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.

I have modified versions of these files with some suggested changes, plus a
simple test applet and associated files that demonstrate the situation. The
sample applet can be launched in a browser either by double-clicking the file
locally or by putting it on a web server and launching it from an http URL. As
soon as I can figure out how to attach to a bug report, I'll do that.

P.S. This topic came up in August, 2004 in lucene dev mailing list but as far as
I can tell, has not yet been resolved."
1,"Fix unexpected behavior of Text.getName()Text.getName() and variants does return an empty string, if the given path is already a name. eg:

0,Support for JNDI configuration of BundleDbPersistenceManagerIt would be nice to have the option to configure BundleDbPersistenceManager database specifying a JNDI name of a DataSource.
0,"activity storage pathJSR-283 states in 15.12.3:

""15.12.3 Activity Storage
Activities are persisted as nodes of type nt:activity under system-generated
node names in activity storage below /jcr:system/jcr:activities.""

As far as I can tell, this is currently not the case.

A related test case, org.apache.jackrabbit.test.api.version.ActivitiesTest#testActivitiesPath, apparently was taken out accidentally.

If Jackrabbit can't implement this JCR requirement, we either need to document it, or raise it as issue in the JCR Expert Group."
0,SimpleTextCodec needs SimpleText DocValues implcurrently SimpleTextCodec uses binary docValues we should move that to a simple text impl.
1,"cache module generates exceptions for non-compliant responses without consuming response bodiesIn the ResponseProtocolCompliance class, the caching module checks the incoming origin response to attempt to make it compliant with RFC2616. However, if there are instances where this is not possible, it currently throws an exception without consuming the origin response body; this causes a connection leak if the general try..catch..finally pattern documented on the HttpClient interface Javadoc is followed.

1,"[PATCH] Wirelog correctionsThis patch 

* fixes the problem reported by Geir H. Pettersen <geir at cellus.no>. See
http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?t=108072355300004&r=1&w=2 for details

* increases the priority of HTTP request/status line & HTTP headers output from
DEBUG to INFO. Quite often request/response content generate excessive amount of
output in the wirelog and produce no valuable debug information of what so ever.
By setting wirelog verbosity to INFO one can turn off the logging of 
request/response content.

I believe the patch should be applied to both CVS HEAD and 2.0 branch. Please
let me know if you agree

0,"Jcr2Spi: UpdateTest#testUpdateRemovesExtraProperty and #testUpdateAddsMissingSubtree fail occasionallyissue reported by jukka:

Every now and then I see the following jcr2spi test failures on a
clean checkout:

    Tests in error:
      testUpdateRemovesExtraProperty(org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.UpdateTest)
      testUpdateAddsMissingSubtree(org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.UpdateTest)

The problem seems to be caused by the test cases automatically
choosing the ""security"" workspace for the update test. The reason why
the tests only fail occasionally is that currently the ordering of the
string array returned by getAccessibleWorkspaceNames() is not
deterministic.

I can work around the issue by making
RepositoryImpl.getWorkspaceNames() explicitly sort the returned array
of names, but a more proper fix would probably be to ensure that the
workspace selected by UpdateTest is useful for the test.

0,"Default to anonymous access when no Credentials are givenEven though JCR-348 made easier to start a Jackrabbit repository with default configuration, the user still needs to take care of the JAAS configuration. It would be more user-friendly to log a warning and default to superuser access rather than throwing a LoginException when JAAS has not been configured. This behaviour should be limited to only default credential logins (Session.login() with null Credentials) and it should be possible to disable it with a configuration option. We could even have this behaviour disabled by default, but enabled in the configuration file used with the JCR-348 automatic configuration.

This is a case against the ""secure by default"" design principle, but I think that in this case the benefits in easier setup outweight the security drawbacks, especially if coupled with the above restrictions and a clear documentation note about the insecure default.

[Update: As mentioned by Stefan, this is  not a JAAS configuration issue but a problem in handling null Credentials. A more proper alternative for superuser access would be to default to anonymous access when credentials are not given.]"

2. create another hierarchy at different level - /site2
3. copy /site/en under /site2
-- till now everything is fine, its a proper copy and if you export xml out of these 2 hierarchies you will see that ""image"" is actually copied

A summary of what was discussed so far:
# Deprecate those two methods.
# Add nextDoc() and skipToDoc(int) that return doc, with default impl in DISI (calls next() and skipTo() respectively, and will be changed to abstract in 3.0).
#* I actually would like to propose an alternative to the names: advance() and advance(int) - the first advances by one, the second advances to target.

1,"thread starving in MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManagerHi folks,

I might have found a bug in MTHCM. It has to do with removing HostConnectionPool instances that have no more connections in them. That was a fix for a memory leak we previously had. There are two cases where the pools get deleted. One is in handleLostConnection: (excerpt)
  ...
  if (hostPool.numConnections == 0) mapHosts.remove(config);
  notifyWaitingThread(config);
  ...

Could this delete a pool in which there is still a thread waiting to get a connection? If so, the thread would remain in the global pool. But even if it is interrupted there, it would still use the old HostConnectionPool in which no connection will ever become available again.

I suggest to change the removal check in both cases to:
  if ((hostPool.numConnections < 1) && hostPool.waitingThreads.isEmpty)

What do you think?"

Hello,

I made two changes to the HttpClient code:

1) in the class ConnectionPool in the method getFreeConnection( ... ) I
changed freeConnections.removeFirst() to freeConnections.removeLast(). Now
the container for free connections behaves as a stack rather than a queue.

2) additionally I changed the IdleConnectionTimeoutThread, in the run()
method I added connectionManager.deleteClosedConnections() so that the pool
size is maintained correctly.

What do you think?

0,"[PATCH] Indexing on Hadoop distributed file systemIn my current project we needed a way to create very large Lucene indexes on Hadoop distributed file system. When we tried to do it directly on DFS using Nutch FsDirectory class - we immediately found that indexing fails because DfsIndexOutput.seek() method throws UnsupportedOperationException. The reason for this behavior is clear - DFS does not support random updates and so seek() method can't be supported (at least not easily).
 
Well, if we can't support random updates - the question is: do we really need them? Search in the Lucene code revealed 2 places which call IndexOutput.seek() method: one is in TermInfosWriter and another one in CompoundFileWriter. As we weren't planning to use CompoundFileWriter - the only place that concerned us was in TermInfosWriter.
 
TermInfosWriter uses IndexOutput.seek() in its close() method to write total number of terms in the file back into the beginning of the file. It was very simple to change file format a little bit and write number of terms into last 8 bytes of the file instead of writing them into beginning of file. The only other place that should be fixed in order for this to work is in SegmentTermEnum constructor - to read this piece of information at position = file length - 8.
 
With this format hack - we were able to use FsDirectory to write index directly to DFS without any problems. Well - we still don't index directly to DFS for performance reasons, but at least we can build small local indexes and merge them into the main index on DFS without copying big main index back and forth.

0,"speed up core testsOur core tests have gotten slower and slower, if you don't have a really fast computer its probably frustrating.

I think we should:
1. still have random parameters, but make the 'obscene' settings like SimpleText rarer... we can always make them happen more on NIGHTLY
2. tests that make a lot of documents can conditionalize on NIGHTLY so that they are still doing a reasonable test on ordinary runs e.g. numdocs = (NIGHTLY ? 10000 : 1000) * multiplier
3. refactor some of the slow huge classes with lots of tests like TestIW/TestIR, at least pull out really slow methods like TestIR.testDiskFull into its own class. this gives better parallelization.
"
0,"Refactor DocumentsWriterI've been working on refactoring DocumentsWriter to make it more
modular, so that adding new indexing functionality (like column-stride
stored fields, LUCENE-1231) is just a matter of adding a plugin into
the indexing chain.

This is an initial step towards flexible indexing (but there is still
alot more to do!).

And it's very much still a work in progress -- there are intemittant
thread safety issues, I need to add tests cases and test/iterate on
performance, many ""nocommits"", etc.  This is a snapshot of my current
state...

The approach introduces ""consumers"" (abstract classes defining the
interface) at different levels during indexing.  EG DocConsumer
consumes the whole document.  DocFieldConsumer consumes separate
fields, one at a time.  InvertedDocConsumer consumes tokens produced
by running each field through the analyzer.  TermsHashConsumer writes
its own bytes into in-memory posting lists stored in byte slices,
indexed by term, etc.

DocumentsWriter*.java is then much simpler: it only interacts with a
DocConsumer and has no idea what that consumer is doing.  Under that
DocConsumer there is a whole ""indexing chain"" that does the real work:

  * NormsWriter holds norms in memory and then flushes them to _X.nrm.

  * FreqProxTermsWriter holds postings data in memory and then flushes
    to _X.frq/prx.

  * StoredFieldsWriter flushes immediately to _X.fdx/fdt

  * TermVectorsTermsWriter flushes immediately to _X.tvx/tvf/tvd

DocumentsWriter still manages things like flushing a segment, closing
doc stores, buffering & applying deletes, freeing memory, aborting
when necesary, etc.

In this first step, everything is package-private, and, the indexing
chain is hardwired (instantiated in DocumentsWriter) to the chain
currently matching Lucene trunk.  Over time we can open this up.

There are no changes to the index file format.

For the most part this is just a [large] refactoring, except for these
two small actual changes:

  * Improved concurrency with mixed large/small docs: previously the
    thread state would be tied up when docs finished indexing
    out-of-order.  Now, it's not: instead I use a separate class to
    hold any pending state to flush to the doc stores, and immediately
    free up the thread state to index other docs.

  * Buffered norms in memory now remain sparse, until flushed to the
    _X.nrm file.  Previously we would ""fill holes"" in norms in memory,
    as we go, which could easily use way too much memory.  Really this
    isn't a solution to the problem of sparse norms (LUCENE-830); it
    just delays that issue from causing memory blowup during indexing;
    memory use will still blowup during searching.

I expect performance (indexing throughput) will be worse with this
change.  I'll profile & iterate to minimize this, but I think we can
accept some loss.  I also plan to measure benefit of manually
re-cycling RawPostingList instances from our own pool, vs letting GC
recycle them.

"
1,"Index segments are only committed on closeThere is a check in AbstractIndex.commit(), which prevents that deleted documents are committed to the index. Up to lucene version 2.0 the index was locked when there were pending changes. Beginning with lucene 2.1 this is not true anymore. See LUCENE-701.

This is a regression of JCR-788, hence it does not occur in a release but only in trunk."

0,"DatabasePersistenceManager: don't log exceptions for each statement when a connection needs to be reestablishedThis is just a ""cosmetic"" fix: when reestablishConnection() is called in DatabasePersistenceManager all the statements are closed but if an error occurs two exceptions are logged for each statement.
Since reestablishConnection() is already called when an exception has been caught and its only purpose is to cleanup an existing connection and to reopen a new one is pretty common that the connection is already not valid and that each statement close will throw an exception.

For example if the connection has been broken due to a network problem DatabasePersistenceManager  will log *40* exceptions (2 for each statement) before trying to establish a connection, and that's pretty annoying (expecially if you use a mail appender for log4j....)

It also leads to sloppy code, eg TermVectorsReader ""gracefully"" handles being opened when the files do not exist.  I don't like that; it should only be opened if they exist.

1,"SharedItemStateManager not properly synchronizedSome time ago we removed synchronized modifiers from the methods store() hasItemState() and getItemState(). While some care has been taken to ensure the cache integrity, I think the contract for the SharedItemStateManager (SISM) is now broken. The JavaDoc does not clearly document this, but I think all relevant methods of the SISM working on ItemStates should be atomic.

E.g. a call to hasItemState() should not return true for an ItemState that another thread is currently adding in store(). Similarly a getItemState() should not return an ItemState that is currenly added or modified in a store() operation.

Currently I see two options:
- Change the methods to synchronized again. This will actually serialize all calls to the SISM.
- Implement a more sophisticated synchronisation. E.g. multiple store operations can still be allowed, as long as their ChangeLogs do not intersect. Retrieving ItemStates might still be allowed while a ChangeLog is stored, as long as the ItemState to retrieve is not part of the ChangeLog.

Comments and suggestions are very welcome."

The current behaviour in jackrabbit is IMO not correct because the version node gets removed, but the version label is still present in the version history. This means there is a referenceable property that points to nowhere.

So I guess either:

- the version label property must be removed as well when the version is removed
or
- the remove version operation should fail because the version is still referenced

            throws IOException

    Constructs an IndexWriter for the index in d. Text will be analyzed with a.
If create is true, then a new, empty index will be created in d, replacing the
index already there, if any.

Parameters:
    d - the index directory
    a - the analyzer to use
    create - true to create the index or overwrite the existing one; false to
append to the existing index 
Throws:
    IOException - if the directory cannot be read/written to, or if it does not
exist, and create is false


We would have this:

IndexWriter

public IndexWriter(Directory d,
                   Analyzer a,
                   boolean clear)
            throws IOException

a new, empty index will be created in d.

Parameters:

    a - the analyzer to use
    clear - true to overwrite the existing one; false to append to the existing
index 
Throws:
    IOException - if the directory cannot be read/written to, or if it does not
exist.



Its current behavior is kind of annoying, because I have an app that should
never clear an existing index, it should always append.  So I want create set to
false.  But when I am starting a brand new index, then I have to change the
create flag to keep it from throwing an exception...  I guess for now I will
have to write code to check if a index actually has content yet, and if it

There is currently no way to extract if a field is numeric from the index, so the user will have to configure the FieldConfig objects in the ConfigHandler. But if this is done, it will not be that difficult to implement the rest.

The only difference between the current handling of RangeQuery is then the instantiation of the correct Query type and conversion of the entered numeric values (simple Number.valueOf(...) cast of the user entered numbers). Evenerything else is identical, NumericRangeQuery also supports the MTQ rewrite modes (as it is a MTQ).

Another thing is a change in Date semantics. There are some strange flags in the current parser that tells it how to handle dates."

Examples of such pre-authentications include SSO solutions or web applications using a web-based authentication protocol not easily implementable in a JAAS LoginModule, for example OpenID or similar.

In such situations a password may not be provided in SimpleCredentials and thus regular login with user name and password is not possible.

Therefore I propose the enhancement of the AbstractLoginModule to allow for setting a specific attribute in the SimpleCredentials attribute map. If this attribute is set, authentication and login succeeds and a session for the user named in the SimpleCredentials is created.

As a starter we might just check for the presence of the attribute."

My test data resides in a database table of 30 columns holding 1.25 million records.   The good news is that performance is superior to Lucene 2.2.  The indexing completes in roughly 1/3 the time.   The bad news is the Index Writer.optimize() step now throws an java.lang.IllegalArgumentException.
I also run tests against various other tables.  Indexing smaller amounts of data did not throw the exception.  Indexing largers amounts of data did throw the exception.  Note, I also tested nightly builds dating back to 2007-10-05.

0,"Add ShingleFilter option to output unigrams if no shingles can be generatedCurrently if ShingleFilter.outputUnigrams==false and the underlying token stream is only one token long, then ShingleFilter.next() won't return any tokens. This patch provides a new option, outputUnigramIfNoNgrams; if this option is set and the underlying stream is only one token long, then ShingleFilter will return that token, regardless of the setting of outputUnigrams.

My use case here is speeding up phrase queries. The technique is as follows:

First, doing index-time analysis using ShingleFilter (using outputUnigrams==true), thereby expanding things as follows:

""please divide this sentence into shingles"" ->
 ""please"", ""please divide""
 ""divide"", ""divide this""
 ""this"", ""this sentence""
 ""sentence"", ""sentence into""
 ""into"", ""into shingles""
 ""shingles""

Second, do query-time analysis using ShingleFilter (using outputUnigrams==false and outputUnigramIfNoNgrams==true). If the user enters a phrase query, it will get tokenized in the following manner:

""please divide this sentence into shingles"" ->
 ""please divide""
 ""divide this""
 ""this sentence""
 ""sentence into""
 ""into shingles""

By doing phrase queries with bigrams like this, I can gain a very considerable speedup. Without the outputUnigramIfNoNgrams option, then a single word query would tokenize like this:

""please"" ->
   [no tokens]

But thanks to outputUnigramIfNoNgrams, single words will now tokenize like this:

""please"" ->
  ""please""

The patch also adds a little to the pre-outputUnigramIfNoNgrams option tests.

if more than 5 threads enter IndexWriter at once, they will ""share""
only 5 thread states, meaning we gate CPU concurrency to 5 running
threads inside IW (each thread must first wait for the last thread to
finish using the thread state before grabbing it).

This is bad because modern hardware can make use of more than 5
threads.  So I think an immediate fix is to make this settable
(expert), and increase the default (8?).

It's tricky, though, because the more thread states, the less RAM
efficiency you have, meaning the worse indexing throughput.  So you
shouldn't up and set this to 50: you'll be flushing too often.

But... I think a better fix is to re-think how threads write state
into DocumentsWriter.  Today, a single docID stream is assigned across
threads (eg one thread gets docID=0, next one docID=1, etc.), and each
thread writes to a private RAM buffer (living in the thread state),
and then on flush we do a merge sort.  The merge sort is inefficient
(does not currently use a PQ)... and, wasteful because we must
re-decode every posting byte.

I think we could change this, so that threads write to private RAM
buffers, with a private docID stream, but then instead of merging on
flush, we directly flush each thread as its own segment (and, allocate
private docIDs to each thread).  We can then leave merging to CMS
which can already run merges in the BG without blocking ongoing
indexing (unlike the merge we do in flush, today).

This would also allow us to separately flush thread states.  Ie, we
need not flush all thread states at once -- we can flush one when it
gets too big, and then let the others keep running.  This should be a
good concurrency gain since is uses IO & CPU resources ""throughout""
indexing instead of ""big burst of CPU only"" then ""big burst of IO
only"" that we have today (flush today ""stops the world"").

One downside I can think of is... docIDs would now be ""less
monotonic"", meaning if N threads are indexing, you'll roughly get
in-time-order assignment of docIDs.  But with this change, all of one
thread state would get 0..N docIDs, the next thread state'd get
N+1...M docIDs, etc.  However, a single thread would still get
monotonic assignment of docIDs.

0,"masking field of span for cross searching across multiple fields (many-to-one style)This issue is to cover the changes required to do a search across multiple fields with the same name in a fashion similar to a many-to-one database. Below is my post on java-dev on the topic, which details the changes we need:

---

We have an interesting situation where we are effectively indexing two 'entities' in our system, which share a one-to-many relationship (imagine 'User' and 'Delivery Address' for demonstration purposes). At the moment, we index one Lucene Document per 'many' end, duplicating the 'one' end data, like so:

    userid: 1
    userfirstname: fred
    addresscountry: au
    addressphone: 1234

    userid: 1
    userfirstname: fred
    addresscountry: nz
    addressphone: 5678

    userid: 2
    userfirstname: mary
    addresscountry: au
    addressphone: 5678

(note: 2 Documents indexed for user 1). This is somewhat annoying for us, because when we search in Lucene the results we want back (conceptually) are at the 'user' level, so we have to collapse the results by distinct user id, etc. etc (let alone that it blows out the size of our index enormously). So why do we do it? It would make more sense to use multiple fields:
    userid: 1
    userfirstname: fred
    addresscountry: au
    addressphone: 1234
    addresscountry: nz
    addressphone: 5678

    userid: 2
    userfirstname: mary
    addresscountry: au
    addressphone: 5678

But imagine the search ""+addresscountry:au +addressphone:5678"". We'd like this to match ONLY Mary, but of course it matches Fred also because he matches both those terms (just for different addresses).

There are two aspects to the approach we've (more or less) got working but I'd like to run them past the group and see if they're worth trying to get them into Lucene proper (if so, I'll create a JIRA issue for them)

1) Use a modified SpanNearQuery. If we assume that country + phone will always be one token, we can rely on the fact that the positions of 'au' and '5678' in Fred's document will be different.

   SpanQuery q1 = new SpanTermQuery(new Term(""addresscountry"", ""au""));
   SpanQuery q2 = new SpanTermQuery(new Term(""addressphone"", ""5678""));
   SpanQuery snq = new SpanNearQuery(new SpanQuery[]{q1, q2}, 0, false);

the slop of 0 means that we'll only return those where the two terms are in the same position in their respective fields. This works brilliantly, BUT requires a change to SpanNearQuery's constructor (which checks that all the clauses are against the same field). Are people amenable to perhaps adding another constructor to SNQ which doesn't do the check, or subclassing it to do the same (give it a protected non-checking constructor for the subclass to call)?

2) (snipped ... see LUCENE-1626 for second idea)"

0,"Allow MergePolicy to select non-contiguous mergesI started work on this but with LUCENE-1044 I won't make much progress
on it for a while, so I want to checkpoint my current state/patch.

For backwards compatibility we must leave the default MergePolicy as
selecting contiguous merges.  This is necessary because some
applications rely on ""temporal monotonicity"" of doc IDs, which means
even though merges can re-number documents, the renumbering will
always reflect the order in which the documents were added to the
index.

Still, for those apps that do not rely on this, we should offer a
MergePolicy that is free to select the best merges regardless of
whether they are continuguous.  This requires fixing IndexWriter to
accept such a merge, and, fixing LogMergePolicy to optionally allow
it the freedom to do so.
"
1,"IndexCommit.getFileNames() should not return dupsIf the index was created with autoCommit false, and more than 1
segment was flushed during the IndexWriter session, then the shared
doc-store files are incorrectly duplicated in
IndexCommit.getFileNames().  This is because that method is walking
through each SegmentInfo, appending its files to a list.  Since
multiple SegmentInfo's may share the doc store files, this causes dups.

To fix this, I've added a SegmentInfos.files(...) method, and
refactored all places that were computing their files one SegmentInfo
at a time to use this new method instead.

0,"Add @Override annotationsDuring removal of deprecated APIs, mostly the problem was, to not only remove the method in the (abstract) base class (e.g. Scorer.explain()), but also remove it in sub classes that override it. You can easily forget that (especially, if the method was not marked deprecated in the subclass). By adding @Override annotations everywhere in Lucene, such removals are simple, because the compiler throws out an error message in all subclasses which then no longer override the method.

Also it helps preventing the well-known traps like overriding hashcode() instead of hashCode().

The patch was generated automatically, and is rather large. Should I apply it, or would it break too many patches (but I think, trunk has changed so much, that this is only a minimum of additional work to merge)?"

1,"Inconsistent behaviour sorting against field with no related documentsIn StringSortedHitQueue - generateSortIndex seems to mistake 
the TermEnum having values as indicating that the sort field 
has entries in the index.

In the case where the search has matching results an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
exception is thrown in sortValue (line 177 StringSortedHitQueue)
as generateSortIndex creates a terms array of zero length and fieldOrder
contains 0 for all documents.

It would seem more helpful if:
a) generateSortIndex catches the lack of any documents with the sort field.

or

b) reserve terms[0] as a special value for documents that do not have
matching sort field values. ie Change the current implementation to add 1
to the index and change terms[0] to ensure it sorts ""untagged"" documents to
first or last.

For my application Id much prefer solution (b) as it allows much smaller 
indexes and make searching using sort values less brittle.

Thats the best my communication skills can muster just now. Could change
current code to something like:

private final int[] generateSortIndex()
throws IOException {

	final int[] retArray = new int[reader.maxDoc()];
	final String[] mterms = new String[reader.maxDoc() + 1];  // guess length
	if (retArray.length > 0) {
		TermDocs termDocs = reader.termDocs();
		// change this value to control if documents without sort field come first or last
		mterms[0] = """";  // XXXXXXXXX change
		int t = 1;  // current term number  XXXXXXXXXXXXX change
		try {
	

			do {
				Term term = enumerator.term();
				if (term.field() != field) break;

				// store term text
				// we expect that there is at most one term per document
				if (t >= mterms.length) throw new RuntimeException (""there are more terms
than documents in field \""""+field+""\"""");
				mterms[t] = term.text();

				// store which documents use this term
				termDocs.seek (enumerator);
				while (termDocs.next()) {
					retArray[termDocs.doc()] = t;
				}

				t++;
			} while (enumerator.next());
		} finally {
			termDocs.close();
		}

		// if there are less terms than documents,
		// trim off the dead array space
		if (t < mterms.length) {
			terms = new String[t];
			System.arraycopy (mterms, 0, terms, 0, t);
		} else {
			terms = mterms;
		}
	}
	return retArray;
}

Having very quick look at IntegerSortedHitQueue would seem possible
to do same thing. Maybe creating Integer wrapper objects once.

Hope that made some sort of sense. Im not very familiar with the code
or Lucene terminology.
If the above seems like a useful approach Id be glad to generate patches
for a cleaned up version.

Thanks

0,"add icu-based tokenizer for unicode text segmentationI pulled out the last part of LUCENE-1488, the tokenizer itself and cleaned it up some.

The idea is simple:
* First step is to divide text into writing system boundaries (scripts)
* You supply an ICUTokenizerConfig (or just use the default) which lets you tailor segmentation on a per-writing system basis.
* This tailoring can be any BreakIterator, so rule-based or dictionary-based or your own.

The default implementation (if you do not customize) is just to do UAX#29, but with tailorings for stuff with no clear word division:
* Thai (uses dictionary-based word breaking)
* Khmer, Myanmar, Lao (uses custom rules for syllabification)

Additionally as more of an example i have a tailoring for hebrew that treats the punctuation special. (People have asked before
for ways to make standardanalyzer treat dashes differently, etc)

0,"Commit volatile index to disc after some configurable idle timeThe query handler keeps the most recent part of the index in memory (volatile index). That index is committed to disc when a certain amount of nodes (config param: minMergeDocs) has been added. Most of the times the volatile index will contain some nodes, causing a redo.log that needs to be applied when the jackrabbit process is killed.

In addition to the size threshold (minMergeDocs) of the volatile index, an idle time limit should force a commit to disc. The volatile index would be written to disc after some configurable idle time. This will result in an persistent index (on dic) which is most of the time in sync with the data, but still minimizes the disc IO during heavy modification activity on the workspace."

I can wrap the IndexCommit objects too just for having a isDeleted() method so a workaround exists. Not a big pain but if it can be managed on the lucene side easily, I'll appreciate it. It would save me from writing some delegate code."
0,"Add static readSnapshotsInfo to PersistentSnapshotDeletionPolicyPSDP persists the snapshots information in a Directory. When you open PSDP, it obtains a write lock on the snapshots dir (by keeping an open IndexWriter), and updates the directory when snapshots are created/released.

This causes problem in the following scenario -- you have two processes, one updates the 'content' index and keeps PSDP open (because it also takes snapshots). Another process wants to read the existing snapshots information and open a read-only IndexReader on the 'content' index. The other process cannot read the existing snapshots information, because p1 keeps a write lock on the snapshots directory.

There are two possible solutions:
# Have PSDP open the IndexWriter over the directory for each snapshot/release. A bit expensive, and unnecessary.
# Introduce a static readSnapshotsInfo on PSDP which accepts a Directory and returns the snapshots information. IMO it's cleaner, and won't have the performance overhead of opening/closing the IW as before.

I'll post a patch (implementing the 2nd approach) shortly. I'd appreciate any comments."

0,"Speed up junit testsAs Lucene grows, so does the number of JUnit tests. This is obviously a good thing, but it comes with longer and longer test times. Now that we also run back compat tests in a standard test run, this problem is essentially doubled.

There are some ways this may get better, including running parallel tests. You will need the hardware to fully take advantage, but it should be a nice gain. There is already an issue for this, and Junit 4.6, 4.7 have the beginnings of something we might be able to count on soon. 4.6 was buggy, and 4.7 still doesn't come with nice ant integration. Parallel tests will come though.

Beyond parallel testing, I think we also need to concentrate on keeping our tests lean. We don't want to sacrifice coverage or quality, but I'm sure there is plenty of fat to skim.

I've started making a list of some of the longer tests - I think with some work we can make our tests much faster - and then with parallelization, I think we could see some really great gains."
0,"DatabaseJournal refactoring for subclassing capabilityIn the 1.3 upgrade to JackRabbit, the DatabasePersistenceManager class was refactored to allow easy subclassing.  On my project, the subclassing is required because the DBAs have a specific naming convention for database columns, and the default JackRabbit columns don't fit within the naming convention.

At this point, we're cutting over to a clustered setup in preparation for production.  In my design, I would like to use the database for journaling.  But once again, the DBAs will want to change the column names to their own naming convention.  The existing DatabaseJournal class is not set up for the same type of subclassing that the PersistenceManager (or even the FileSystem) hierarchies.  I'd like the DatabaseJournal class to be updated accordingly.

In specific, here are the changes I'm looking for:

* Extract protected instance variables for selectRevisionsStmtSql, updateGlobalStmtSql, selectGlobalStmtSql, and insertRevisionStmtSql.
* Extract method protected void buildSQLStatements() which sets up the above sqls, and allows subclasses to override.
* Update the existing prepareStatements method to use the above instance variables.
* Update the init method to call the buildSQLStatements method before the call to prepareStatements."
0,"MergeException from CMS threads should record the DirectoryWhen you hit an unhandled exception in ConcurrentMergeScheduler, it
throws a MergePolicy.MergeException, but there's no easy way to figure
out which index caused this (if you have more than one).

I plan to add the Directory to the MergeException.  I also made a few
other small changes to ConcurrentMergeScheduler:

  * Added handleMergeException method, which is called on exception,
    so that you can subclass ConcurrentMergeScheduler to do something
    when an exception occurs.

  * Added getMergeThread() method so you can override how the threads
    are created (eg, if you want to make them in a different thread
    group, use a pool, change priorities, etc.).

  * Added doMerge(...) to actually do this merge, so you can do
    something before starting and after finishing a merge.

  * Changed private -> protected on a few attrs

0,"High memory usage on node with multi-valued string propertiesMulti-valued string properties are tokenized per value, which may consume quite some memory when there are lots of small values in on a property. The memory footprint is 2k per value, because each value is tokenized with a separate tokenizer instance. That tokenizer uses a stream buffer of 2k bytes.

Instead the values should be concatenated (whitespace separated) and then tokenized in one go."

0,"IndexReader.close should forcefully evict entries from FieldCacheSpinoff of java-user thread ""heap memory issues when sorting by a string field"".

We rely on WeakHashMap to hold our FieldCache, keyed by reader.  But this lacks immediacy on releasing the reference, after a reader is closed.

WeakHashMap can't free the key until the reader is no longer referenced by the app. And, apparently, WeakHashMap has a further impl detail that requires invoking one of its methods for it to notice that a key has just become only weakly reachable.

To fix this, I think on IR.close we should evict entries from the FieldCache, as long as the sub-readers are truly closed (refCount dropped to 0)."

0,"Get rid of backwards tagsThis is a followup on: [http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/bb6c23b6e87c0b63/back_compat_folders_in_tags_when_i_svn_update#3000a2232c678031]

Currently we use tags for specifying the revision number in the backwards branch that matches the current development branch revision (in common-build.xml). The idea is to just specify the corresponding revision no of the backwards branch in common-build.xml and the backwards-test target automatically handles up/down/co:

- We just give the rev number in common-build in common-build.xml as a property backwards-rev=""XXXX"". This property is used also in building the command line which is also a property backwards-svn-args=""-r $backwards-rev"". By that you can use ""ant -Dbackwards-svn-args=''"" to force test-backwards to checkout/update to head of branch (recommened for developers).

- we should rename target to ""test-backwards"" and keep a ""test-tag"" with dependency to that for compatibility

- The checkout on backwards creates a directory ""backwards/${backwards-branch}"" and uses ""svn co ${backwards-svn-args} 'http://svn.../${backwards-branch}' 'backwards/${backwards-branch}'"". The cool thing, the dir is checked out if non existent, but if the checkout already exists, svn co implicitely does an svn up to the given revision (it will also downgrade and merge if newer). So the test-backwards target always updates the checkout to the correct revision. I had not tried with local changes, but this should simply merge as an svn up.

The workflow for committing fixes to bw would be:

- First use ""svn up"" to upgrade the backwards working copy to HEAD.
- Commit the changes
- Copy and paste the message ""Committed revision XXXX"" to common-build.xml
- Commit the changes in trunk

I haven't looked at it much myself but i'll play around a bit, but at a glance:
* SegmentReader to have Bits liveDocs instead of BitVector
* address the TODO in the IW-using ctors so that SegmentReader doesn't take a parent but just an existing core.
* we need some type of minimal ""MutableBits"" or similar subinterface of bits. BitVector and maybe Fixed/OpenBitSet could implement it
* BitVector becomes an impl detail and moves to codec (maybe we have a shared base class and split the 3.x/4.x up rather than the conditional backwards)
* I think the invertAll should not be used by IndexWriter, instead we define the codec interface to say ""give me a new MutableBits, by default all are set"" ?
* redundant internally-consistent checks in checkLiveCounts should be done in the codec impl instead of in SegmentReader.
* plain text impl in SimpleText."

0,"Break the spi2dav dependency to jcr-serverCurrently the spi2dav component has a dependency on the jcr-server component, which is troublesome due to the extra transitive dependencies and which strictly speaking should not be necessary from an architectural point of view.

The dependency exists mostly for sharing a number of JCR-specific WebDAV constants. I'd like to push those constants down to jackrabbit-webdav as they are essentially just shared strings and as jackrabbit-webdav already contains a number of constants used by JCR extensions.

In addition to constant values, code in the following classes is shared between jcr-server and spi2dav: JcrValueType, NamespacesProperty, NodeTypesProperty, SearchResultProperty, SubscriptionImpl, ValuesProperty. The shared code in JcrValueType and SubscriptionImpl is mostly just about mapping constant value mappings and could fairly easily be moved to jackrabbit-webdav. The Property classes are a but trickier, but it looks like it would be possible to split the code to separate server- and client-side classes for jcr-server and spi2dav."

1,"Cloning a tree containing shareable nodes into another workspace throws ItemExistsExceptionThere's a problem when trying to clone a tree in another workspace, when this tree contains shareable nodes.

Let ws1 be one workspace, which contains one node A. This node has two sub-nodes B and C. B and C share a shareable sub-node D :

A

B  C
|    |
D  D

Let ws2 be a second workspace. Then calling ws2.clone(""ws1"" , ""/A"" , ""/A"" , false) throws an ItemExistsException ( copyNodeState line 1628 ) . This is done when the copyNodeState is checking if the nodeId is already present in the workspace - which is the case when copying the second instance of the shareable node. I can't find in the specification something about this case - but it would be logical to add a share to the node when coming across this situation - at least in the CLONE ( and probable COPY too ) cases. I don't know what would be expected in the CLONE_REMOVE_EXISTING case - we might not want to remove the node if it's shareable, and also add a share here.

I fixed the issue by handling the case the node is shareable in the COPY and CLONE cases of copyNodeState - you'll find attached the corresponding patch. Do you think this solution is ok ?"

0,"IndexWriter.close(false) does not actually stop background merge threadsRight now when you close(false), IndexWriter marks any running merges
as aborted but then does not wait for these merges to finish.  This
can cause problems because those threads still hold files open, so,
someone might think they can call close(false) and then (say) delete
all files from that directory, which would fail on Windows.

Instead, close(false) should notify each running merge that it has
been aborted, and not return until all running merges are done.  Then,
SegmentMerger should periodically check whether it has been aborted
and stop if so.

0,PackedInts does not support structures above 256MBThe PackedInts Packed32 and Packed64 fails when the internal structure exceeds 256MB. This is due to a missing cast that results in the bit position calculation being limited by Integer.MAX_VALUE (256MB * 8 = 2GB).
0,"[PATCH] Enable application-level management of IndexWriter.ramDirectory sizeIndexWriter currently only supports bounding of in the in-memory index cache using maxBufferedDocs, which limits it to a fixed number of documents.  When document sizes vary substantially, especially when documents cannot be truncated, this leads either to inefficiencies from a too-small value or OutOfMemoryErrors from a too large value.

This simple patch exposes IndexWriter.flushRamSegments(), and provides access to size information about IndexWriter.ramDirectory so that an application can manage this based on total number of bytes consumed by the in-memory cache, thereby allow a larger number of smaller documents or a smaller number of larger documents.  This can lead to much better performance while elimianting the possibility of OutOfMemoryErrors.

The actual job of managing to a size constraint, or any other constraint, is left up the applicatation.

The addition of synchronized to flushRamSegments() is only for safety of an external call.  It has no significant effect on internal calls since they all come from a sychronized caller.

0,"HTTPClient per default relentlessly spams to stderrHTTPClient relentlessly spams to stderr when including it into a project via maven. This is not a decent default behaviour for a libary. Libaries should, per default, communicate their internal state solely and adequatly via their API and let it be up to the application to react to that state (logging it is one such reaction). From some replies to tickets in the same vain I can see that this is perhaps a sensitive topic as some see logging to be a core concern of HTTPClient. I do agree it's helpful as a debugging tool but as such it needs to be opt-in. As a standard error output, the logging of HTTPClient is absolutely useless because it does not and can not describe what the application is trying to do.

Why this improvement when there is a way to disable HTTClient logging (in fact, there seem to be many ways ... always a bad sign ..)?

Do a google search for: httpclient ""console spam""
204 hit for this harsh phrasing alone. Search this phrase for any other libary you like to use and compare the number of hits. Ask youself, how often have you seen the java standard libary write to stdout or stderr?

Personally, I tried to disable it via JDK14 getLogger(""org.apache"").setLevel(Level.OFF)  which wouldn't work and now am using a solution I found on Stackoverflow which is:

System.setProperty(""org.apache.commons.logging.Log"", ""org.apache.commons.logging.impl.NoOpLog""); }

The problem I have is that I include this lib and suddently my console is useless because httpclient is all over it (writing a system monitor ...). I have to search google to find a solution (http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/logging.html does not tell you how to turn logging off ...) and the logical one ""turn of the JDK logger"" does not work right away.

It's really a matter of following the principal of least suprise (a libary is not expected to write to the console which is the observable default behaviour of HTTPClient) and the principal of separation of concerns (logging is a concern for applications and not for libaries).

Following at least one of these would substantially increase the joy of working with the HTTPClient libary.

0,Factor out SearcherManager from NRTManagerCurrently we have NRTManager and SearcherManager while NRTManager contains a big piece of the code that is already in SearcherManager. Users are kind of forced to use NRTManager if they want to have SearcherManager goodness with NRT. The integration into NRTManager also forces you to maintain two instances even if you know you always want deletes. To me NRTManager tries to do more than necessary and mixes lots of responsibilities ie. handling searchers and handling indexing generations. NRTManager should use a SearcherManager by aggregation rather than duplicate a lot of logic. SearcherManager should have a NRT and Directory based implementation users can simply choose from.

0,"Allow concurrent index updates and queriesCurrently the query handler either allows one modification or multiple queries at a time. That is, write operations are separated from read operations. With this synchronization scheme multiple queries may run concurrently, but only in the absence of a write operation.

There is one major drawback with this synchronization: a single long running query is able to block the whole workspace from committing changes. Because the query handler is coupled to the Workspace via a synchronous event listener, further processing is blocked until the query handler has finished its event processing (reflecting the changes in the index).

Instead, each index modification should be non-blocking, in the sense that an index modification should not have to wait for any queries to complete."

0,"date encoding limitation removingcurrently there is some limitation to date encoding in lucene. I think it's 
because dates should preserve lexicografical ordering, i.e. if one date precedes 
another date then encoded values should keep same ordering.

I know that it can be difficult to integrate it into existing version but there 
is way to remove this limitation.
Date milliseconds can be encoded as unsigned values with prefix that indicates 
positive or negative value.

In more details:
I used hex encoding and prefix &#8216;p&#8217; and &#8216;n&#8217; for positive and negative values. I 
got following results:

Value -10000 is encoded with nffffffffffffd8f0, 
-100	- nffffffffffffff9c
0	- p0000000000000000
100	- p0000000000000064
10000	- p0000000000002710

This preserves ordering between values and theirs encoding.

Also hex encoding can be replaced with Character.MAX_RADIX encoding.

0,"Authorization credentials should be sent pre-emptivelyWhen a web browser receives a <i>401: Unauthorized</i> response code, the
browser prompts for the user and password credentials for the requested
authentication realm.  An Authorization header is then sent for this request. 
HttpClient models this behaviour quite well.

After the web browser has the authentication credentials for a given host, port
and realm, it then sends the Authorization header for subsequent requests
pre-emptively, whithout need for a 401 response.  HttpClient always reqires a
401 response before it will send out the Authorization header.

As <code>HttpClient.startSession()</code> will take a <code>Credentials</code>
object as a parameter as the default credentials, the default credentials should
be sent as part of every request in that session.  Some mechanisim for
over-riding the default credentials should also be provided to be sent
pre-emptively.

The point of this enhancement request is to minimize the number of unnecessisary
401 responses.

It appears that the simple solution might be to modify the logic of when

    private static final String CHILD = ""bar"";
    private static final String PTYPE = ""nt:bar"";
    
    public void testRemoveMixin() throws RepositoryException {
        Session session = getSession();
        Node root = session.getRootNode().addNode(""root"");
        root.addMixin(MIXIN);
        
        root.addNode(CHILD, PTYPE);
        root.addNode(CHILD, PTYPE);
        root.addNode(CHILD, PTYPE);
        
        session.save();
        
        for (NodeIterator it = root.getNodes(); it.hasNext(); ) {
            Node node = it.nextNode();
            System.out.println(node.getPath() + "" : "" + node.getUUID());
        }
        
        try {

            root.save();
        } catch (RepositoryException ex) {

0,"Field Selection and Lazy Field LoadingThe patch to come shortly implements a Field Selection and Lazy Loading mechanism for Document loading on the IndexReader.

It introduces a FieldSelector interface that defines the accept method:
FieldSelectorResult accept(String fieldName);

(Perhaps we want to expand this to take in other parameters such as the field metadata (term vector, etc.))

Anyone can implement a FieldSelector to define how they want to load fields for a Document.  
The FieldSelectorResult can be one of four values: LOAD, LAZY_LOAD, NO_LOAD, LOAD_AND_BREAK.  
The FieldsReader, as it is looping over the FieldsInfo, applies the FieldSelector to determine what should be done with the current field.

I modeled this after the java.io.FileFilter mechanism.  There are two implementations to date: SetBasedFieldSelector and LoadFirstFieldSelector.  The former takes in two sets of field names, one to load immed. and one to load lazily.  The latter returns LOAD_AND_BREAK on the first field encountered.  See TestFieldsReader for examples.

It should support UTF-8 (I borrowed code from Issue 509, thanks!).  See TestFieldsReader for examples

I added an expert method on IndexInput  named skipChars that takes in the number of characters to skip.  This is a compromise on changing the file format of the fields to better support seeking.  It does some of the work of readChars, but not all of it.  It doesn't require buffer storage and it doesn't do the bitwise operations.  It just reads in the appropriate number of bytes and promptly ignores them.  This is useful for skipping non-binary, non-compressed stored fields.

The biggest change is by far the introduction of the Fieldable interface (as per Doug's suggestion from a mailing list email on Lazy Field loading from a while ago).  Field is now a Fieldable.  All uses of Field have been changed to use Fieldable.  FieldsReader.LazyField also implements Fieldable.

Lazy Field loading is now implemented.  It has a major caveat (that is Documented) in that it clones the underlying IndexInput upon lazy access to the Field value.  IT IS UNDEFINED whether a Lazy Field can be loaded after the IndexInput parent has been closed (although, from what I saw, it does work).  I thought about adding a reattach method, but it seems just as easy to reload the document.  See the TestFieldsReader and DocHelper for examples.

I updated a couple of other tests to reflect the new fields that are on the DocHelper document.

All tests pass."

Before registering the new node type definition the old node type is unregistered. The side effect of that first step is that also all NodeTypes, which depend (extend ?) the node type to be re-registered, are removed from the registry.

After the modified node type is then registered, the previously registered dependent node types will not be registered anymore and will not be known any more.

0,"Add way to check for release of connections back into poolAs the documentation emphasizes, its important to clean up HttpEntities after use, so they don't tie up the default very small number of connections in the pool.

However, nothing is provided to HttpClient users with the default classes that allows them to unit test their code to help verify that they are in fact properly releasing the connections under all circumstances. One way this could be done is for the API to expose the number of current leased (taken) connections in the pool, which would be connManager.pool.leasedConnections.size() if not for the necessary fields being protected. If this statistic were published through the API, user unit tests could check that it is zero when they finish.

A workaround is for the user to subclass both the connection manager and ConnPoolByRoute and add getter methods. But its kind of a clunky solution, and I think the API should be written to encourage its users to perform this check."

0,"Add workaround for ICU bug in combination with Java7 to LuceneTestCaseThere is a bug in ICU that makes it fail to load it ULocale class in Java7: http://bugs.icu-project.org/trac/ticket/8734

The problem is caused by some new locales in Java 7, that lead to a chicken-and-egg problem in the static initializer of ULocale. It initializes its default locale from the JDK locale in a static ctor. Until the default ULocale instance is created, the default is not set in ULocale. But ULocales ctor itsself needs the default locale to fetch some ressource bundles and throws NPE.

The code in LuceneTestCase that randomizes the default locale should classload ULocale before it tries to set another random locale, using a defined, safe locale (Locale.US). Patch is easy."

0,"Buffered output to socket--Posted by Slavik Markovich:

Hi all,

This is probably a known issue (but I haven't found the answer for it yet).
I'm using httpclient to post data to a remote server but as far as I can see
(using ethereal) the client is writing every line to the wire without buffering.
After examining the code, I can see that the HttpConnection class is using the
output stream received from the socket directly.
Is there a reason for the direct writing?
This is a problem for me 'cause the remote server sets a very low timeout and
returns a bad request response after receiving the request line (without any
other header line or request body).

Can I easily add a buffered behavior to the http client?

0,"InstantiatedIndex - faster but memory consuming indexRepresented as a coupled graph of class instances, this all-in-memory index store implementation delivers search results up to a 100 times faster than the file-centric RAMDirectory at the cost of greater RAM consumption.

Performance seems to be a little bit better than log2n (binary search). No real data on that, just my eyes.

Populated with a single document InstantiatedIndex is almost, but not quite, as fast as MemoryIndex.    

At 20,000 document 10-50 characters long InstantiatedIndex outperforms RAMDirectory some 30x,
15x at 100 documents of 2000 charachters length,
and is linear to RAMDirectory at 10,000 documents of 2000 characters length.

Mileage may vary depending on term saturation.

one of the new cookies is reported to be added as:

i.e. the same as without using a proxy. 7295 is the port number used to access the proxy. The target domain www.seoconsultants.com is accessed through the regular HTTP port number 80, thus the cookie matching should also refer to port 80 and not the proxy's port."

0,"Utility to output total term frequency and df from a lucene indexThis is a pair of command line utilities that provide information on the total number of occurrences of a term in a Lucene index.  The first  takes a field name, term, and index directory and outputs the document frequency for the term and the total number of occurrences of the term in the index (i.e. the sum of the tf of the term for each document).   The second reads the index to determine the top N most frequent terms (by document frequency) and then outputs a list of those terms along with  the document frequency and the total number of occurrences of the term. Both utilities are useful for estimating the size of the term's entry in the *prx files and consequent Disk I/O demands. "
0,"Work around ThreadLocal's ""leak""Java's ThreadLocal is dangerous to use because it is able to take a
surprisingly very long time to release references to the values you
store in it.  Even when a ThreadLocal instance itself is GC'd, hard
references to the values you had stored in it are easily kept for
quite some time later.

While this is not technically a ""memory leak"", because eventually
(when the underlying Map that stores the values cleans up its ""stale""
references) the hard reference will be cleared, and GC can proceed,
its end behavior is not different from a memory leak in that under the
right situation you can easily tie up far more memory than you'd
expect, and then hit unexpected OOM error despite allocating an
extremely large heap to your JVM.

Lucene users have hit this many times.  Here's the most recent thread:

  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-dev/200809.mbox/%3C6e3ae6310809091157j7a9fe46bxcc31f6e63305fcdc%40mail.gmail.com%3E

And here's another:

  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-dev/200807.mbox/%3CF5FC94B2-E5C7-40C0-8B73-E12245B91CEE%40mikemccandless.com%3E

And then there's LUCENE-436 and LUCENE-529 at least.

A google search for ""ThreadLocal leak"" yields many compelling hits.

Sun does this for performance reasons, but I think it's a terrible
trap and we should work around it with Lucene."
1,"Missing Content-Length header causes a SocketExceptionEssentially, we have an invalid HTTP server (Stellent CMS actually and we will file a bug with them), 
which is returning headers like:

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic ""Secure Realm""
Connection: keep-alive

Which is clearly missing the Content-Length header.  Now, previously HttpClient handled this 
perfectly by reading until the end of the connection (ie: treating it like it was a Connection: close), 
however for some reason a socket exception is being thrown and the invalid connection is added 
back into the connection pool and then every connection to the server after that thows an 
exception.

See the thread ""SocketException with invalid server"" for the full discussion of the issue.

I'll attach a patch that fixes the problem.  The biggest thing to consider is the changes to the 
duplicate Connection header test cases which resolves around the question: if Connection: keep-
alive is present but no Content-Length is provided, should the connection be closed?  The patch 
requires the answer to be yes and I really can't see any other way to do it."

0,"Avoid element arrays in PathImplThe path handling code in spi-commons shows quite often in thread dumps and profiling results, as the current implementation does quite a bit of repetitive allocating and copying of path element arrays. We should be able to streamline and simplify the path handling code by only tracking the latest path element and a reference to the parent path. To do this efficiently we may need to adjust some of the Path and PathFactory method declarations (that currently assume element array -based paths) also in the SPI.

0,"Realm from authentication challenge unavailableThere is currently no way to extract the authentication realm from HttpClient 
except to extract the authentication challenge header and parse it manually.

Either the realm needs to be available to the client or a method in 
Authenticator should extract the realm from a given authentication header.

The same problems occurs with determining which type of authentication is 
being used and what other options there are (basic, digest, NTLM, others)."

0,"[PATCH] new method: Document.remove()Here's a patch that adds a remove() method to the Document class (+test case). This 
is very useful if you have converter classes that return a Lucene Document object but 
you need to make changes to that object. 
 
In my case, I wanted to index PDF files that were saved as BLOBs in a database. The 
files need to be saved to a temporary file and that file name is given to the PDF 
converter class. The PDF converter then saves the name of the temporary file name 
as the file name, which doesn't make sense. So my code needs to remove the 
'filename' field and re-add it, this time with the columns primary ID. This is only possible 
with the attached patch."

0,"Directory createOutput and openInput should take an IOContextToday for merging we pass down a larger readBufferSize than for searching because we get better performance.

I think we should generalize this to a class (IOContext), which would hold the buffer size, but then could hold other flags like DIRECT (bypass OS's buffer cache), SEQUENTIAL, etc.

Then, we can make the DirectIOLinuxDirectory fully usable because we would only use DIRECT/SEQUENTIAL during merging.

This will require fixing how IW pools readers, so that a reader opened for merging is not then used for searching, and vice/versa.  Really, it's only all the open file handles that need to be different -- we could in theory share del docs, norms, etc, if that were somehow possible."

0,"TCK: observation tests are too restrictiveThe basic sequence in all observation tests is:

1) add listener

3) remove listener

This sequence forces an implementation to maintain a logical order for listener registrations and content changes. In the light of the asynchronous nature of observation events this seems too restrictive for certain implementations.

The sequence should be changed to:

1) add listener
2) modify workspace
3) wait for events on listener
4) remove listener

1,"errors in text filters can cause indexing to fail without warning the clienti've opened this issue to track the discussion at <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.jackrabbit.devel/5086>. briefly, exceptions thrown by text filters are logged and swallowed by jackrabbit; there's no way for a text filter to signal to the jcr client that indexing failed.

some solutions have been proposed, including throwing an unchecked exception, which doesn't allow jackrabbit to maintain transactional integrity, and giving filters veto power over the observed repository operation. depending on the difficulty of the solution that is eventually determined to be correct, it may be sufficient for 1.0 to document the issue and perhaps improve the warning/error logging.

* indexDictionary(Dictionary dict): this causes optimize!
* indexDictionary(Dictionary dict, int mergeFactory, int ramMB): this causes optimize!
* indexDictionary(Dictionary dict, int mergeFactor, int ramMB, boolean optimize)

But no way to specify an IndexwriterConfig. Additionally, I don't like that several of these ctors force an optimize in a tricky way,
even though it was like this all along.

So I think we should add indexDictionary(Dictionary dict, IndexWriterConfig config, boolean optimize).

We should either deprecate all the other ctors in 3.x and nuke in trunk, or at least add warnings to the ones that optimize."
1,"DistanceFilter problem with deleted documentsI know this is the locallucene lib, but wanted to make sure we don't get this bug when it gets into lucene contrib.

0,"Query Syntax page does not make it clear that wildcard searches are not allowed in Phrase QueriesThe queryparsersyntax page which is where I expect most novices (such as myself) start with lucene seems to indicate that wildcards can be used in phrase terms

Quoting:
'Terms: A query is broken up into terms and operators. There are two types of terms: Single Terms and Phrases.
A Single Term is a single word such as ""test"" or ""hello"".
A Phrase is a group of words surrounded by double quotes such as ""hello dolly"".

....

Wildcard Searches
Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches.
To perform a multiple character wildcard search use the ""*"" symbol.
Multiple character wildcard searches looks for 0 or more characters. For example, to search for test, tests or tester, you can use the search:

test*
You can also use the wildcard searches in the middle of a term.

'
there is nothing to indicate in the section on Wildcard Searches that it can be performed only on Single word terms not Phrase terms.

Chris  argues 'that there is nothing in the description of a Phrase to indicate that it can be anything other then what it says ""a group of words surrounded by double quotes"" .. at no point does it
suggest that other types of queries or syntax can be used inside the quotes.  likewise the discussion of Wildcards makes no mention of phrases to suggest that wildcard characters can be used in a phrase.'
but I don't accept this because there is nothing in the description of a Single Term either to indicate it can use wildcards either. Wildcards are only mentioned in the Wildcard section and there it says thay can be used in a term, it does not restrict the type of term


I Propose a simple solution modify:

Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches.

to 

Lucene supports single and multiple character wildcard searches within single terms.

Furthermore the same bug can exist in removing-filters if they have enablePositionIncrements=false.

don't add gaps. 

If you remove tokens with enablePositionIncrements=false it should not cause the TS to start with
positionincrement=0, and it shouldnt 'restructure' the tokenstream (e.g. moving synonyms on top of a different word).
It should just not add any 'holes'.

1,"DocumentWriter closes TokenStreams too earlyThe DocumentWriter closes a TokenStream as soon as it has consumed its tokens. The javadoc of TokenStream.close() says that it releases resources associated with the stream. However, the DocumentWriter keeps references of the resources (i. e. payload byte arrays, term strings) until it writes the postings to the new segment, which means that DocumentWriter should call TokenStream.close() after it has written the postings.

This problem occurs in multithreaded applications where e. g. pooling is used for the resources. My patch adds a new test to TestPayloads which shows this problem. Multiple threads add documents with payloads to an index and use a pool of byte arrays for the payloads. TokenStream.close() puts the byte arrays back into the pool. The test fails with the old version but runs successfully with the patched version.

0,"Extend FieldCache architecture to multiple ValuesI would consider this a bug. It appears lots of people are working around this limitation, 
why don't we just change the underlying data structures to natively support multiValued fields in the FieldCache architecture?

Then functions() will work properly, and we can do things like easily geodist() on a multiValued field.

Thoughts?"
0,"Restore mix:referenceable check to SessionImpl.getNodeByUUIDIn revision 504623 we commented out the mix:referenceable check in the SessionImpl.getNodeByUUID() method:

    // since the uuid of a node is only exposed through jcr:uuid declared
    // by mix:referenceable it's rather unlikely that a client can possibly
    // know the internal uuid of a non-referenceable node; omitting the
    // check for mix:referenceable seems therefore to be a reasonable
    // compromise in order to improve performance.
    /*
    if (node.isNodeType(Name.MIX_REFERENCEABLE)) {
        return node;
    } else {
        // there is a node with that uuid but the node does not expose it
        throw new ItemNotFoundException(uuid.toString());
    }
    */

This solved a minor performance issue issue with client code that used the node UUID as a quick way to access a node. The downside was a slight incompatibility with the spec that says that the getNodeByUUID method is only supposed to work with mix:referenceable nodes.

Now with JCR 2.0 clients can (and should) use the Session.getNodeByIdentifier method that does not have the mix:referenceable limitation. Thus we can restore the original and correct functionality of the getNodeByUUID method."
1,"IndexWriter.setMaxMergeDocs gives non-backwards-compatible exception ""out of the box""Yonik hit this (see details in LUCENE-994): because we have switched
to LogByteSizeMergePolicy by default in IndexWriter, which uses MB to
limit max size of merges (setMaxMergeMB), when an existing app calls
setMaxMergeDocs (or getMaxMergeDocs) it will hit an
IllegalArgumentException on dropping in the new JAR.

I think the simplest solution is to fix LogByteSizeMergePolicy to
allow setting of the max by either MB or by doc count, just like how
in LUCENE-1007 allows flushing by either MB or docCount or both."
1,"Base64 bug - last buffer not flushedI found an issue when using the org.apache.jackrabbit.util.Base64.encode(InputStream in, OutputStream out) method.

I was able to work around this issue by creating a Writer my own program, and call another encode method, and then call the flush() method before using the data. The source in trunk appears the same.

Here, ""scrofula"" and ""struma"" are extraneous. This happens because, the line
parser code in Syns2Index.java interpretes the two consecutive single quotes
in entry s(114144247,3,'king''s evil',n,1,1) in  wn_s.pl file, as
termination
of the string and separates into ""king"". This entry concerns
synset of words ""scrofula"" and ""struma"", and thus they get inserted in the
synset of ""king"". *There 1382 such entries, in wn_s.pl* and more in other
WordNet
Prolog data-base files, where such use of two consecutive single quotes
appears.

We have resolved this by adding a statement in the line parsing portion of
Syns2Index.java, as follows:

           // parse line
           line = line.substring(2);
          * line = line.replaceAll(""\'\'"", ""`""); // added statement*
           int comma = line.indexOf(',');
           String num = line.substring(0, comma);  ... ... etc.
In short we replace ""''"" by ""`"" (a back-quote). Then on recreating the
index, we get:

java SynLookup zwnindex king
baron
magnate
mogul
power

0,"Use bulk-byte-copy when merging term vectorsIndexing all of Wikipedia, with term vectors on, under the YourKit
profiler, shows that 26% of the time (!!) was spent merging the
vectors.  This was without offsets & positions, which would make
matters even worse.

Depressingly, merging, even with ConcurrentMergeScheduler, cannot in
fact keep up with the flushing of new segments in this test, and this
is on a strong IO system (Mac Pro with 4 drive RAID 0 array, 4 CPU
cores).

So, just like Robert's idea to merge stored fields with bulk copying
whenever the field name->number mapping is ""congruent"" (LUCENE-1043),
we can do the same with term vectors.

It's a little trickier because the term vectors format doesn't quite
make it easy to bulk-copy because it doesn't directly encode the
offset into the tvf file.

I worked out a patch that changes the tvx format slightly, by storing
the absolute position in the tvf file for the start of each document
into the tvx file, just like it does for tvd now.  This adds an extra
8 bytes (long) in the tvx file, per document.

Then, I removed a vLong (the first ""position"" stored inside the tvd
file), which makes tvd contents fully position independent (so you can
just copy the bytes).

This adds up to 7 bytes per document (less for larger indices) that
have term vectors enabled, but I think this small increase in index
size is acceptable for the gains in indexing performance?

With this change, the time spent merging term vectors dropped from 26%
to 3%.  Of course, this only applies if your documents are ""regular"".
I think in the future we could have Lucene try hard to assign the same
field number for a given field name, if it had been seen before in the
index...

Merging terms now dominates the merge cost (~20% over overall time
building the Wikipedia index).

I also beefed up TestBackwardsCompatibility unit test: test a non-CFS
and a CFS of versions 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 index formats, and added some
term vector fields to these indices.
"
0,"Minimize use of fields in lucene indexCurrently every property name creates a field in the lucene index, bloating the size of the index because of the norm files created for each field.

When values are indexed as is (not tokenized for fulltext indexing), then the property name may be part of the term text. That way lucene must only maintain one field for all property names. With this approach the search terms are always a combination of property name and literal value. e.g. instead of using TermQuery(new Term(""prop"", ""foo"")) the query must be TermQuery(new TermQuery(""common-field"", ""prop:foo"")). this works for general comparison / value comparison operators and also for the like function. the contains function uses the fulltext index which uses a different field anyway.

Using the property name as part of the indexed term text, requires a custom SortComparator which is aware of the property name.

This change will not be backward compatible with earlier indexes created by jackrabbit."

1,"Importing strings with special characters failsBoth Session.importXML and Workspace.importXML don't work correctly in some cases.

Importing very large foreign language (for example, Chinese) text property values could result in incorrect values on some platforms. The reason is, BufferedStringValue (buffers very large string to a temporary file) uses the platform default encoding to read and write the text.

BufferedStringValue is relatively slow on some systems when importing large texts or binary data because of using FD().sync().

If an exported string value contains a carriage return (\r), this character was truncated on some platforms.

0,"CompoundFileWriter should pre-set its file lengthI've read that if you are writing a large file, it's best to pre-set
the size of the file in advance before you write all of its contents.
This in general minimizes fragmentation and improves IO performance
against the file in the future.

I think this makes sense (intuitively) but I haven't done any real
performance testing to verify.

Java has the java.io.File.setLength() method (since 1.2) for this.

We can easily fix CompoundFileWriter to call setLength() on the file
it's writing (and add setLength() method to IndexOutput).  The
CompoundFileWriter knows exactly how large its file will be.

Another good thing is: if you are going run out of disk space, then,
the setLength call should fail up front instead of failing when the
compound file is actually written.  This has two benefits: first, you
find out sooner that you will run out of disk space, and, second, you
don't fill up the disk down to 0 bytes left (always a frustrating
experience!).  Instead you leave what space was available
and throw an IOException.

My one hesitation here is: what if out there there exists a filesystem
that can't handle this call, and it throws an IOException on that
platform?  But this is balanced against possible easy-win improvement
in performance.

this?

0,"Remove write access from SegmentReader and possibly move to separate class or IndexWriter/BufferedDeletes/...After LUCENE-3606 is finished, there are some TODOs:

SegmentReader still contains (package-private) all delete logic including crazy copyOnWrite for validDocs Bits. It would be good, if SegmentReader itsself could be read-only like all other IndexReaders.

There are two possibilities to do this:
# the simple one: Subclass SegmentReader and make a RWSegmentReader that is only used by IndexWriter/BufferedDeletes/... DirectoryReader will only use the read-only SegmentReader. This would move all TODOs to a separate class. It's reopen/clone method would always create a RO-SegmentReader (for NRT).
# Remove all write and commit stuff from SegmentReader completely and move it to IndexWriter's readerPool (it must be in readerPool as deletions need a not-changing view on an index snapshot).

Unfortunately the code is so complicated and I have no real experience in those internals of IndexWriter so I did not want to do it with LUCENE-3606, I just separated the code in SegmentReader and marked with TODO. Maybe Mike McCandless can help :-)"

1,"Cluster information is not persisted to database when connected to case sensitive MS SQL Server 2005After a call to Session::save, we observed that cluster information was not written to the ${schemaObjectPrefix}JOURNAL and ${schemaObjectPrefix}GLOBAL_REVISION tables. We tested against Oracle 10 database servers and MS Sql Server 2005 servers. The problem was noticed only with MS Sql Server 2005. 

Initially, the problem was masked since the test was written as part of our unit test environment and the exceptions generated by JDBC were not showing up in the logs. A separate test with was carried out as shown by the code below

<pre>
import java.io.FileInputStream;

import javax.jcr.Node;
import javax.jcr.Repository;
import javax.jcr.Session;
import javax.jcr.SimpleCredentials;

import org.apache.jackrabbit.core.TransientRepository;
import org.apache.jackrabbit.core.config.RepositoryConfig;

public class Main
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
        throws Exception
    {
        System.setProperty(""org.apache.jackrabbit.core.cluster.node_id"", ""testid"");
        
        RepositoryConfig config = RepositoryConfig.create(new FileInputStream(""repository.xml""), ""repository"");
        
        Repository repository = new TransientRepository();
        
        Session session = repository.login(new SimpleCredentials(""username"", ""password"".toCharArray()));

        root.addNode(""node2"");
        root.addNode(""node3"");
        
        session.save();
    }
}
</pre>

The configuration file used to configure the repository is attached.

After debugging this, we obtained the exceptions that were previously not visible. Note that, JackRabbit continues to run (is that because the cluster code is running in a separate thread?) even after this exception. The problem was that the 'revision_id' field did not exist. The mssql.ddl schema file sets up the table names in capitals. However, at least two of the SQL statements in DatabaseJournal use lower case table names. For example:-

<pre>
        updateGlobalStmt = con.prepareStatement(
                ""update "" + schemaObjectPrefix + ""global_revision "" +
                ""set revision_id = revision_id + 1"");
        selectGlobalStmt = con.prepareStatement(
                ""select revision_id "" +
                ""from "" + schemaObjectPrefix + ""global_revision"");
</pre>

An additional error is that the mssql.ddl file is missing the following:

<pre>
# Inserting the one and only revision counter record now helps avoiding race conditions
insert into ${schemaObjectPrefix}GLOBAL_REVISION VALUES(0)
</pre>

Fixing the above two issues, fixed the problem with MS SQL Server 2005."

Recently, few concurrency bugs were fixed in SearcherManager, and I realized that I need to apply them to my version as well. Which led me to think why can't we have an SM version which is generic enough so that both my version and Lucene's can benefit from?

The way I see SearcherManager, it can be divided into two parts: (1) the part that manages the logic of acquire/release/maybeReopen (i.e., ensureOpen, protect from concurrency stuff etc.), and (2) the part which handles IndexSearcher, or my SearcherTaxoPair. I'm thinking that if we'll have an interface with incRef/decRef/tryIncRef/maybeRefresh, we can make SearcherManager a generic class which handles this interface.

That copy can possibly (rather rarely) result in new merges becoming
eligible because its size can change if the index being added was
created with autoCommit=false.

However, we fail to then invoke the MergeScheduler to run these
merges.  As a result, in close, where we wait until all running and
pending merges complete, we will never return.

The fix is simple: invoke the merge scheduler inside
copyExternalSegments() if any segments were copied.  I also added
defensive invocation of the merge scheduler during close, just in case
other code paths could allow for a merge to be added to the pending

1,"Problems with BundleDbPersistenceManager getAllNodeIdsWhen using MySQL:
The problem arises when the method parameter maxcount is less than the total amount of records in the bundle table.

First of all I found out that mysql orders the nodeid objects different than jackrabbit does. The following test describes this idea:

    public void testMySQLOrderByNodeId() throws Exception {
        NodeId nodeId1 = new NodeId(""7ff9e87c-f87f-4d35-9d61-2e298e56ac37"");
        NodeId nodeId2 = new NodeId(""9fd0d452-b5d0-426b-8a0f-bef830ba0495"");

        PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(""SELECT NODE_ID FROM DEFAULT_BUNDLE WHERE NODE_ID = ? OR NODE_ID = ? ORDER BY NODE_ID"");

        Object[] params = new Object[] { nodeId1.getRawBytes(), nodeId2.getRawBytes() };
        stmt.setObject(1, params[0]);
        stmt.setObject(2, params[1]);

        ArrayList<NodeId> nodeIds = new ArrayList<NodeId>();
        ResultSet resultSet = stmt.executeQuery();
        while(resultSet.next()) {
            NodeId nodeId = new NodeId(resultSet.getBytes(1));
            System.out.println(nodeId);
            nodeIds.add(nodeId);
        }
        Collections.sort(nodeIds);
        for (NodeId nodeId : nodeIds) {
            System.out.println(nodeId);
        }
    }

Which results in the following output:

7ff9e87c-f87f-4d35-9d61-2e298e56ac37
9fd0d452-b5d0-426b-8a0f-bef830ba0495

7ff9e87c-f87f-4d35-9d61-2e298e56ac37


Now the problem with the getAllNodeIds method is that it fetches an extra 10 records on top of maxcount (to avoid a problem where the first key is not the one you that is wanted). Afterwards it skips a number of records again, this time using nodeid.compareto. This compareto statement returns true unexpectedly for mysql because the code doesn't expect the mysql ordering.

I had the situation where I had about 17000 records in the bundle table but consecutively getting the ids a thousand records at a time returned only about 8000 records in all.

0,"Change IndexSearcher multisegment searches to search each individual segment using a single HitCollectorThis issue changes how an IndexSearcher searches over multiple segments. The current method of searching multiple segments is to use a MultiSegmentReader and treat all of the segments as one. This causes filters and FieldCaches to be keyed to the MultiReader and makes reopen expensive. If only a few segments change, the FieldCache is still loaded for all of them.

This patch changes things by searching each individual segment one at a time, but sharing the HitCollector used across each segment. This allows FieldCaches and Filters to be keyed on individual SegmentReaders, making reopen much cheaper. FieldCache loading over multiple segments can be much faster as well - with the old method, all unique terms for every segment is enumerated against each segment - because of the likely logarithmic change in terms per segment, this can be very wasteful. Searching individual segments avoids this cost. The term/document statistics from the multireader are used to score results for each segment.

When sorting, its more difficult to use a single HitCollector for each sub searcher. Ordinals are not comparable across segments. To account for this, a new field sort enabled HitCollector is introduced that is able to collect and sort across segments (because of its ability to compare ordinals across segments). This TopFieldCollector class will collect the values/ordinals for a given segment, and upon moving to the next segment, translate any ordinals/values so that they can be compared against the values for the new segment. This is done lazily.

All and all, the switch seems to provide numerous performance benefits, in both sorted and non sorted search. We were seeing a good loss on indices with lots of segments (1000?) and certain queue sizes / queries, but the latest results seem to show thats been mostly taken care of (you shouldnt be using such a large queue on such a segmented index anyway).

* Introduces
** MultiReaderHitCollector - a HitCollector that can collect across multiple IndexReaders. Old HitCollectors are wrapped to support multiple IndexReaders.
** TopFieldCollector - a HitCollector that can compare values/ordinals across IndexReaders and sort on fields.
** FieldValueHitQueue - a Priority queue that is part of the TopFieldCollector implementation.
** FieldComparator - a new Comparator class that works across IndexReaders. Part of the TopFieldCollector implementation.
** FieldComparatorSource - new class to allow for custom Comparators.
* Alters
** IndexSearcher uses a single HitCollector to collect hits against each individual SegmentReader. All the other changes stem from this ;)

1,"DisjunctionSumScorer gives slightly (float iotas) different scores when you .nextDoc vs .advanceSpinoff from LUCENE-1536.

I dug into why we hit a score diff when using luceneutil to benchmark
the patch.

At first I thought it was BS1/BS2 difference, but because of a bug in
the patch it was still using BS2 (but should be BS1) -- Robert's last
patch fixes that.

But it's actually a diff in BS2 itself, whether you next or advance
through the docs.

It's because DisjunctionSumScorer, when summing the float scores for a
given doc that matches multiple sub-scorers, might sum in a different
order, when you had .nextDoc'd to that doc than when you had .advance'd
to it.

This in turn is because the PQ used by that scorer (ScorerDocQueue)

1,"TermSpans skipTo() doesn't always move forwardsIn TermSpans (or the anonymous Spans class returned by SpansTermQuery, depending on the version), the skipTo() method is improperly implemented if the target doc is less than or equal to the current doc:

  public boolean skipTo(int target) throws IOException {
          // are we already at the correct position?
          if (doc >= target) {
            return true;
          }

          ...


This violates the correct behavior (as described in the Spans interface documentation), that skipTo() should always move forwards, in other words the correct implementation would be:

if (doc >= target) {
  return next();
}

This bug causes particular problems if one wants to use the payloads feature - this is because if one loads a payload, then performs a skipTo() to the same document, then tries to load the ""next"" payload, the spans hasn't changed position and it attempts to load the same payload again (which is an error)."

0,"TopTermsScoringBooleanQueryRewrite minscorewhen using the TopTermsScoringBooleanQueryRewrite (LUCENE-2123), it would be nice if MultiTermQuery could set an attribute specifying the minimum required score once the Priority Queue is filled. 

This way, FilteredTermsEnums could adjust their behavior accordingly based on the minimal score needed to actually be a useful term (i.e. not just pass thru the pq)

An example is FuzzyTermsEnum: at some point the bottom of the priority queue contains words with edit distance of 1 and enumerating any further terms is simply a waste of time.
This is because terms are compared by score, then termtext. So in this case FuzzyTermsEnum could simply seek to the exact match, then end.

This behavior could be also generalized for all n, for a different impl of fuzzyquery where it is only looking in the term dictionary for words within edit distance of n' which is the lowest scoring term in the pq (they adjust their behavior during enumeration of the terms depending upon this attribute).

Other FilteredTermsEnums could make use of this minimal score in their own way, to drive the most efficient behavior so that they do not waste time enumerating useless terms.

0,"FastVectorHighlighter: support for additional queriesI am using fastvectorhighlighter for some strange languages and it is working well! 

One thing i noticed immediately is that many query types are not highlighted (multitermquery, multiphrasequery, etc)
Here is one thing Michael M posted in the original ticket:

{quote}
I think a nice [eventual] model would be if we could simply re-run the
scorer on the single document (using InstantiatedIndex maybe, or
simply some sort of wrapper on the term vectors which are already a
mini-inverted-index for a single doc), but extend the scorer API to
tell us the exact term occurrences that participated in a match (which
I don't think is exposed today).
{quote}

Due to strange requirements I am using something similar to this (but specialized to our case).
I am doing strange things like forcing multitermqueries to rewrite into boolean queries so they will be highlighted,
and flattening multiphrasequeries into boolean or'ed phrasequeries.
I do not think these things would be 'fast', but i had a few ideas that might help:

* looking at contrib/highlighter, you can support FilteredQuery in flatten() by calling getQuery() right?
* maybe as a last resort, try Query.extractTerms() ?

0,"improve how IndexWriter uses RAM to buffer added documentsI'm working on a new class (MultiDocumentWriter) that writes more than
one document directly into a single Lucene segment, more efficiently
than the current approach.

This only affects the creation of an initial segment from added
documents.  I haven't changed anything after that, eg how segments are
merged.

The basic ideas are:

  * Write stored fields and term vectors directly to disk (don't
    use up RAM for these).

  * Gather posting lists & term infos in RAM, but periodically do
    in-RAM merges.  Once RAM is full, flush buffers to disk (and
    merge them later when it's time to make a real segment).

  * Recycle objects/buffers to reduce time/stress in GC.

  * Other various optimizations.

Some of these changes are similar to how KinoSearch builds a segment.
But, I haven't made any changes to Lucene's file format nor added
requirements for a global fields schema.

So far the only externally visible change is a new method
""setRAMBufferSize"" in IndexWriter (and setMaxBufferedDocs is
deprecated) so that it flushes according to RAM usage and not a fixed
number documents added.

The problem is that two different hashCodes with the same lower bits will keep picking the same slots (the upper bits will be ignored).
This is because multiplication (*1347) only really shifts bits to the left... so given that the two codes already matched on the right, they will both pick the same increment, and this will keep them on the same path through the table (even though it's being added to numbers that differ on the left).  To resolve this, some bits need to be moved to the right when calculating the increment.

0,"DateTools.java general improvementsApplying the attached patch shows the improvements to DateTools.java that I think should be done. All logic that does anything at all is moved to instance methods of the inner class Resolution. I argue this is more object-oriented.

1. In cases where Resolution is an argument to the method, I can simply invoke the appropriate call on the Resolution object. Formerly there was a big branch if/else.
2. Instead of ""synchronized"" being used seemingly everywhere, synchronized is used to sync on the object that is not threadsafe, be it a DateFormat or Calendar instance.
3. Since different DateFormat and Calendar instances are created per-Resolution, there is now less lock contention since threads using different resolutions will not use the same locks.
4. The old implementation of timeToString rounded the time before formatting it. That's unnecessary since the format only includes the resolution desired.
5. round() now uses a switch statement that benefits from fall-through (no break).

Another debatable improvement that could be made is putting the resolution instances into an array indexed by format length. This would mean I could remove the switch in lookupResolutionByLength() and avoid the length constants there. Maybe that would be a bit too over-engineered when the switch is fine."

a quick glance at the code seems to indicate that MultiSearcher has code 
for calcuating the docFreq accross all of the Searchables when searching 
(or when the docFreq method is explicitly called) but that explain method 
just delegates to Searchable that the specific docid came from.

if you compare that Explanation score you got with the score returned by 
a HitCollector (or TopDocs) they probably won't match.

So i would say ""yes MultiSearcher calculates IDF properly, but 
MultiSeracher.explain is broken.  Please file a bug about this, i can't

    String startDate = getLocalizedDate(2002, 1, 1, false);
    String endDate = getLocalizedDate(2002, 1, 4, false);

if you look at the helper getLocalizedDate, you can see if the 4th argument is false, it does not initialize all date field functions.

  private String getLocalizedDate(int year, int month, int day, boolean extendLastDate) {
 Calendar calendar = new GregorianCalendar();

I think the solution to this is that in all tests, whereever we create new GregorianCalendar(), it should be followed by a call to Calendar.clear().

0,"Some concurrency improvements for NRTSome concurrency improvements for NRT

I found & fixed some silly thread bottlenecks that affect NRT:

  * Multi/DirectoryReader.numDocs is synchronized, I think so only 1
    thread computes numDocs if it's -1.  I removed this sync, and made
    numDocs volatile, instead.  Yes, multiple threads may compute the
    numDocs for the first time, but I think that's harmless?

  * Fixed BitVector's ctor to set count to 0 on creating a new BV, and
    clone to copy the count over; this saves CPU computing the count
    unecessarily.

  * Also strengthened assertions done in SR, testing the delete docs
    count.

I also found an annoying thread bottleneck that happens, due to CMS.
Whenever CMS hits the max running merges (default changed from 3 to 1
recently), and the merge policy now wants to launch another merge, it
forces the incoming thread to wait until one of the BG threads
finishes.

This is a basic crude throttling mechanism -- you force the mutators
(whoever is causing new segments to appear) to stop, so that merging
can catch up.

Unfortunately, when stressing NRT, that thread is the one that's
opening a new NRT reader.

So, the first serious problem happens when you call .reopen() on your
NRT reader -- this call simply forwards to IW.getReader if the reader
was an NRT reader.  But, because DirectoryReader.doReopen is
synchronized, this had the horrible effect of holding the monitor lock
on your main IR.  In my test, this blocked all searches (since each
search uses incRef/decRef, still sync'd until LUCENE-2156, at least).
I fixed this by making doReopen only sync'd on this if it's not simply
forwarding to getWriter.  So that's a good step forward.

This prevents searches from being blocked while trying to reopen to a
new NRT.

However... it doesn't fix the problem that when an immense merge is
off and running, opening an NRT reader could hit a tremendous delay
because CMS blocks it.  The BalancedSegmentMergePolicy should help
here... by avoiding such immense merges.

But, I think we should also pursue an improvement to CMS.  EG, if it
has 2 merges running, where one is huge and one is tiny, it ought to
increase thread priority of the tiny one.  I think with such a change
we could increase the max thread count again, to prevent this
starvation.  I'll open a separate issue....

1,"Deadlock in acl.EntryCollector / ItemManagerHere's another three-way deadlock that we've encountered:

* Thread B wants to write something and blocks waiting for the SISM write lock (since A holds the lock)
* Thread C wants to read something and blocks waiting for the SISM read lock (since B waits for the lock)

Normally such a scenario is handled without any problems, but there's a problem if the session used by thread C has a synchronous observation listener that attempts to read something from the repository during event delivery. In this case the following can happen:

* Thread C holds the ItemManager synchronization lock higher up in the call chain
* Observation listener code called by thread A attempts to read something from the repository, and blocks trying to acquire the ItemManager synchronization lock (since C holds it)

In principle such a scenario should never happen as an observation listener (much less a synchronous one) should never try to use the session that might already be in use by another thread.

1,"Benchmark package uses new TopFieldCollector but also still uses AUTO without resolving it - result is, our sort algorithms won't runAUTO does not work with TopFieldCollector. If you want to use AUTO with TopFieldCollector, we have a convienence method called detectType on SortField, but it is package protected and so cannot be used here as a stop gap or by users if they wanted to mix AUTO with TopFieldCollector. Lucene does still handle this for back compat internally. Solr got bit here when it was switched to use TopFieldCollector - no auto resolution was added (detectType help couldn't have been used due to visibility), and the result was that plugin code that used to be able to use AUTO would now blow up. You shouldn't use AUTO in Solr anyway though.

The Benchmark package got bit as well  when it moved to TopFieldCollector. Sort algorithms allowed auto if you specified it, or if you left off the type. Now our sort algs fail because they didn't specify a type.

I'll change to require the type to be specified to get the algs working again. I was thinking of just putting auto resolution in as a stop gap till 3.0 (when auto is removed), but since detectFieldType is package protected and I don't want to repeat it, disallowing auto seems the best way to go."

1,"spi2dav: ItemInfoCache causes failure of (Workspace)RestoreTest#testRestoreWithUUIDConflict and variantswhile running the API version tests i found the (Workspace)RestoreTest.testRestoreWithUUIDConfict and variants failing. to be precise the test passes but
transiently removing the versionableNode2 in the teardown fails upon removal of the jcr:uuid property of the moved childnode.

having a closer look at it revealed that the problem is caused in the WorkspaceItemStateFactory where the property entry is retrieved from the
cache and subsequently checking if the path really matches fails. for test purposes i prevented the usage of the cached entry by returning false in WorkspaceItemStateFactory.isUpToDate  => the tests passed. 

as far as i know the same tests pass with spi2jcr.
michael, could it be that this is caused by a flaw in the iteminfo-cache logic? or is there something specific that needs to be adjusted in spi2dav?"

1,"Parsing built-in CND and XML nodetypes does not result in equal nt-definitionsi created a test in order to make sure builtin-nodetypes.xml and builtin-nodetypes.cnd provide the same definitions (actually i only wanted to test my own changes).

it reveals that the existing built-in NodeTypeDefinitions are not equal due to the following reason:

- in the xml-format nt:base is always specified if no other super type extends from nt:base
- in the cnd notation the nt:base is omitted (see below for quote from appendix of jsr 283) even if other super type(s) are
  defined and none of them extends from nt:base.

this affects the following nodetypes (all extending from mix:referenceable only):

nt:versionHistory
nt:version
nt:frozenNode
nt:resource


quote from public-review of jsr 283:

""7.2.2.4 Supertypes [...]
After the node type name comes the optional list of supertypes. If this element is not present and the node type is not a mixin (see 7.2.2.5 Options), then a supertype of nt:base is assumed.""


I'm not totally sure, if according to the quote above the built-in cnd-definitions are valid at all. since it states, that the nt:base is assumed if no other super type is defined. In the case of the node types above, mix:referenceable is defined to be the only super type, which is not totally true... the non-mixin types are always sub types of nt:base.

In either case: From my understanding the node types resulting from parsing the xml and the cnd file should be equal.
If the definitions are valid, we may need to adjust the CompactNodeTypeDefReader.

1,"IW.getReader() returns inconsistent reader on RT BranchI extended the testcase TestRollingUpdates#testUpdateSameDoc to pull a NRT reader after each update and asserted that is always sees only one document. Yet, this fails with current branch since there is a problem in how we flush in the getReader() case. What happens here is that we flush all threads and then release the lock (letting other flushes which came in after we entered the flushAllThread context, continue) so that we could concurrently get a new segment that transports global deletes without the corresponding add. They sneak in while we continue to open the NRT reader which in turn sees inconsistent results.

0,"jcr:deref and parent axis in xpath predicatesCurrently, the jcr:deref() function is not allowed in a xpath query predicate. Example :
book holds a reference property on its author(s)

We want all books from a specific author :

/jcr:root/element(*, bookType)[jcr:deref(@author, 'authorType')/@name = 'King']

This fails with an InvalidQueryException currently (not supported).

The error is raised in the XPathQueryBuilder class, in function : private QueryNode createFunction(SimpleNode node, QueryNode queryNode), in the block :
else if (NameFormat.format(JCR_DEREF, resolver).equals(fName))

Problem is that with this query, when evaluating the jcr:deref() function, then in this method at this point, queryNode.getType() is 0 and tests raise the exception if queryNode.getType() is neither QueryNode.TYPE_LOCATION nor QueryNode.TYPE_PATH.

I think this is a useful place to put a deref function in a query, as I don't know how we could test the referenced node properties another way.

0,"Add MergePolicy to IndexWriterConfigNow that IndexWriterConfig is in place, I'd like to move MergePolicy to it as well. The change is not straightforward and so I've kept it for a separate issue. MergePolicy requires in its ctor an IndexWriter, however none can be passed to it before an IndexWriter actually exists. And today IW may create an MP just for it to be overridden by the application one line afterwards. I don't want to make iw member of MP non-final, or settable by extending classes, however it needs to remain protected so they can access it directly. So the proposed changes are:

* Add a SetOnce object (to o.a.l.util), or Immutable, which can only be set once (hence its name). It'll have the signature SetOnce<T> w/ *synchronized set<T>* and *T get()*. T will be declared volatile, so that get() won't be synchronized.
* MP will define a *protected final SetOnce<IndexWriter> writer* instead of the current writer. *NOTE: this is a bw break*. any suggestions are welcomed.
* MP will offer a public default ctor, together with a set(IndexWriter).
* IndexWriter will set itself on MP using set(this). Note that if set will be called more than once, it will throw an exception (AlreadySetException - or does someone have a better suggestion, preferably an already existing Java exception?).

That's the core idea. I'd like to post a patch soon, so I'd appreciate your review and proposals."

0,"Add IW.add/updateDocuments to support nested documentsI think nested documents (LUCENE-2454) is a very compelling addition
to Lucene.  It's also a popular (many votes) issue.

Beyond supporting nested document querying, which is already an
incredible addition since it preserves the relational model on
indexing normalized content (eg, DB tables, XML docs), LUCENE-2454
should also enable speedups in grouping implementation when you group
by a nested field.

For the same reason, it can also enable very fast post-group facet
counting impl (LUCENE-3097) when you what to
count(distinct(nestedField)), instead of unique documents, as your
""identifier"".  I expect many apps that use faceting need this ability
(to count(distinct(nestedField)) not distinct(docID)).

To support these use cases, I believe the only core change needed is
the ability to atomically add or update multiple documents, which you
cannot do today since in between add/updateDocument calls a flush (eg
due to commit or getReader()) could occur.

This new API (addDocuments(Iterable<Document>), updateDocuments(Term
delTerm, Iterable<Document>) would also further guarantee that the
documents are assigned sequential docIDs in the order the iterator
provided them, and that the docIDs all reside in one segment.

Segment merging never splits segments apart, so this invariant would
hold even as merges/optimizes take place.

1,"Create or Append mode determined before obtaining write lockIf an IndexWriter(""writer1"") is opened in CREATE_OR_APPEND mode, it determines whether to CREATE or APPEND before obtaining the write lock.  When another IndexWriter(""writer2"") is in the process of creating the index, this can result in writer1 entering create mode and then waiting to obtain the lock.  When writer2 commits and releases the lock, writer1 is already in create mode and overwrites the index created by write2.

This bug was probably effected by LUCENE-2386 as prior to that Lucene generated an empty commit when a new index was created.  I think the issue could still have occurred prior to that but the two IndexWriters would have needed to be opened nearly simultaneously and the first IndexWriter would need to release the lock before the second timed out."

0,"MergePolicy should require an IndexWriter upon constructionMergePolicy does not require an IW upon construction, but requires one to be passed as method arg to various methods. This gives the impression as if a single MP instance can be shared across various IW instances, which is not true for all MPs (if at all). In addition, LogMergePolicy uses the IW instance passed to these methods incosistently, and is currently exposed to potential NPEs.

This issue will change MP to require an IW instance, however for back-compat reasons the following changes will be made:
# A new MP ctor w/ IW as arg will be introduced. Additionally, for back-compat a default ctor will also be declared which will assign null to the member IW.
# Methods that require IW will be deprecated, and new ones will be declared.
#* For back-compat, the new ones will not be made abstract, but will throw UOE, with a comment that they will become abstract in 3.0.
# All current MP impls will move to use the member instance.
# The code which calls MP methods will continue to use the deprecated methods, passing an IW even that it won't be necessary --> this is strictly for back-compat.

In 3.0, we'll remove the deprecated default ctor and methods, and change the code to not call the IW method variants anymore.

I hope that I didn't leave anything out. I'm sure I'll find out when I work on the patch :)."

0,"WikipediaTokenizerI have extended StandardTokenizer to recognize Wikipedia syntax and mark tokens with certain attributes.  It isn't necessarily complete, but it does a good enough job for it to be consumed and improved by others.

It sets the Token.type() value depending on the Wikipedia syntax (links, internal links, bold, italics, etc.) based on my pass at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Tutorial

I have only tested it with the benchmarking EnwikiDocMaker wikipedia stuff and it seems to do a decent job.

Caveats:  I am not sure how to best handle testing, since the content is licensed under GNU Free Doc License, I believe I can't copy and paste a whole document into the unit test.  I have hand coded one doc and have another one that just generally runs over the benchmark Wikipedia download.

One more question is where to put it.  It could go in analysis, but the tests at least will have a dependency on Benchmark.  I am thinking of adding a new contrib/wikipedia where this could grow to have other wikipedia things (perhaps we would move EnwikiDocMaker there????) and reverse the dependency on Benchmark.

I will post a patch over the next few days."

0,"XMLPersistenceManager fails after creating too many directories on linuxWhen using the  XMLPersistenceManager it creates a bunch of directories in jackrabbit/home/version/data. Eventually I reach 32000 directories in the data directory and subsequent writes fail.

I believe this is caused by XMLPersistenceManager.buildNodeFolderPath() method where it does 
   if (cnt == 4 || cnt == 8) {
      sb.append('/');
   }

This causes the subdirectories to be 4 characters, 0-f i.e. 16^4 which is 65536, if what I'm seeing is correct, on linux ext3, it's limited to 32000 entries. If the XMLPersistence manager used 2 or 3 characters this should fix the problem, or if it were configurable it would also solve this (I think).

an 
   ls jackrabbit/home/version/data | wc -l
returns 
   32001

1,"Removal of versions throws javax.jcr.ReferentialIntegrityExceptionFrom the following thread : http://www.mail-archive.com/jackrabbit-dev%40incubator.apache.org/msg03483.html

When trying to remove a version of a Node  the VersionHistory.removeVersion() method throws : ""javax.jcr.ReferentialIntegrityException: Unable to remove version. At least once referenced."".

Secton 8.2.2.10 (Removal of Versions) of the specification indicates that the version graph should be automatically repaired upon removal. Then, VersionHistory.removeVersion() should take care of references. (In fact, a user cannot alter the references (jcr:predecessors and jcr:successors), since they are protected properties.)

Here's the example (*updated) :

Node root1 = session.getRootNode() ;
Node test1 = root1.addNode(""test"") ;
test1.addMixin(""mix:versionable"");
test1.setProperty(""test"", ""1"");
session.save();
test1.checkin();

test1.checkout();
test1.setProperty(""test"", ""2"");
session.save();
test1.checkin();

test1.checkout();
test1.setProperty(""test"", ""3"");
session.save();
test1.checkin();

String baseVersion = test1.getBaseVersion().getName();
System.out.println(""Base version name: "" + baseVersion);

VersionHistory vh = test1.getVersionHistory();
for (VersionIterator vi = vh.getAllVersions(); vi.hasNext(); ) {
    Version currenVersion = vi.nextVersion();
    String versionName = currenVersion.getName();
    if (!versionName.equals(""jcr:rootVersion"") && !versionName.equals(baseVersion)) { 
        String propertyValue = currenVersion.getNode(""jcr:frozenNode"").getProperty(""test"").getString();
        System.out.println(""Removing version : "" + versionName + "" with value: "" + propertyValue);

0,"Tests using Version.LUCENE_CURRENT will produce problems in backwards branch, when development for 3.2 startsA lot of tests for the most-recent functionality in Lucene use Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, which is fine in trunk, as we use the most recent version without hassle and changing this in later versions.

The problem is, if we copy these tests to backwards branch after 3.1 is out and then start to improve analyzers, we then will have the maintenance hell for backwards tests. And we loose backward compatibility testing for older versions. If we would specify a specific version like LUCENE_31 in our tests, after moving to backwards they must work without any changes!

To not always modify all tests after a new version comes out (e.g. after switching to 3.2 dev), I propose to do the following:
- declare a static final Version TEST_VERSION = Version.LUCENE_CURRENT (or better) Version.LUCENE_31 in LuceneTestCase(4J).
- change all tests that use Version.LUCENE_CURRENT using eclipse refactor to use this constant and remove unneeded import statements.

When we then move the tests to backward we must only change one line, depending on how we define this constant:
- If in trunk LuceneTestCase it's Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, we just change the backwards branch to use the version numer of the released thing.
- If trunk already uses the LUCENE_31 constant (I prefer this), we do not need to change backwards, but instead when switching version numbers we just move trunk forward to the next major version (after added to Version enum)."

0,"Multivalued property sorted by last/random valueSorting on multivalued property may produce incorrect result because sorting is performed only by last value of multivalued property.
Steps to reproduce:
1. Create multivalued field in repository. Example from nodetypes file:
<propertyDefinition name=""MyProperty"" requiredType=""String"" autoCreated=""false"" mandatory=""false""
   onParentVersion=""COPY"" protected=""false"" multiple=""false"">
2. Create few records so that all records except one would contain single value for MyProperty and one record would contain 
first value which is greater then of any other record and the second value is somewhere in the middle. Here is an example:
1st record: ""aaaa""
2nd record: ""cccc""
3rd record: ""dddd"", ""bbbb""
3. Run some query which sorts Example of XPath query:
//*[...here are some criteria...] order by @MyProperty ascending
The query would return documents in such order:
""aaaa""
""dddd"", ""bbbb""
""cccc""
which is not expected order (expected same order as they were entered - as ""aaaa"" < ""cccc"", ""cccc"" < ""dddd"")

After some digging I found out that it happens because method 
org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.SharedFieldCache.getValueIndex
(called from org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.SharedFieldSortComparator.SimpleScoreDocComparator constructor)
returns only last Comparable of the document. Here is overwrites previous value:
retArray[termDocs.doc()] = getValue(value, type);

I tried to concatenate comparables (just to check if it would work for my case):
	if(retArray[termDocs.doc()] == null) {
		retArray[termDocs.doc()] = getValue(value, type);
	} else {
		retArray[termDocs.doc()] =
				retArray[termDocs.doc()] + "" "" + getValue(value, type);
	}
But it didn't worked well either - TermEnum returns terms not in the same order as JackRabbit returns values of multivalued field
(as an example [""qwer"", ""asdf""] may become [""asdf"", ""qwer""] ). So, simple concatenation doesn't help.

0,"IndexWriter.mergeSegments should not hold the commit lock while cleaning up.Same happens in IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers).

The commit lock should be obtained whenever the Index structure/version is read or written.  It should be kept for as short a period as possible.

The write lock is needed to make sure only one IndexWriter or IndexReader instance can update the index (multiple IndexReaders can of course use the index for searching).

The list of files that can be deleted is stored in the file ""deletable"".  It is only read or written by the IndexWriter instance that holds the write lock, so there's no need to have the commit lock to to update it.

On my production system deleting the obsolete segment files after a mergeSegments() happens can occasionally take several seconds(!) and the commit lock blocks the searcher machines from updating their IndexReader instance.
Even on a standalone machine, the time to update the segments file is about 3ms, the time to delete the obsolete segments about 30ms.

The jcr-webapp project will still contain a SimpleWebdavServlet (for backwards compatibility maintaing the same name) which just extends the new servlet and implements the getRepository() method using the RepositoryAccess servlet.

This allows for the reuse of the jcr-server project including the abstract SimpleWebdavServlet in other environments. My intention is to include this project (along with the webdav) project in Sling.

0,"CMS merge throttling is not aggressive enoughI hit this crab while working on the NRT benchmarker (in luceneutil).

CMS today forcefully idles any incoming threads, when there are too many merges pending.

This is the last line of defense that it has, since it also juggles thread priorities (and forcefully idles the biggest merges) to try to reduce the outstanding merge count.

But when it cannot keep up it has no choice but to stall those threads responsible for making new segments.

However, the logic is in the wrong place now -- the stalling happens after pulling the next merge from IW.  This is poor because it means if you have N indexing threads, you allow max + N outstanding merges.

I have a simple fix, which is to just move the stall logic to before we pull the next merge from IW."

0,"norms file can become unexpectedly enormous
Spinoff from this user thread:

   http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/46754

Norms are not stored sparsely, so even if a doc doesn't have field X
we still use up 1 byte in the norms file (and in memory when that
field is searched) for that segment.  I think this is done for
performance at search time?

For indexes that have a large # documents where each document can have
wildly varying fields, each segment will use # documents times # fields
seen in that segment.  When optimize merges all segments, that product
grows multiplicatively so the norms file for the single segment will
require far more storage than the sum of all previous segments' norm
files.

I think it's uncommon to have a huge number of distinct fields (?) so
we would need a solution that doesn't hurt the more common case where
most documents have the same fields.  Maybe something analogous to how
bitvectors are now optionally stored sparsely?

One simple workaround is to disable norms.

In fact, all Scorers should use TermPositions, because custom subclasses of existing scorers might want to access payloads, which is only possible via TermPositions.

0,"Port to Java5For my needs I've updated Lucene so that it uses Java 5 constructs. I know Java 5 migration had been planned for 2.1 someday in the past, but don't know when it is planned now. This patch against the trunk includes :

- most obvious generics usage (there are tons of usages of sets, ... Those which are commonly used have been generified)
- PriorityQueue generification
- replacement of indexed for loops with for each constructs
- removal of unnececessary unboxing

The code is to my opinion much more readable with those features (you actually *know* what is stored in collections reading the code, without the need to lookup for field definitions everytime) and it simplifies many algorithms.

Note that this patch also includes an interface for the Query class. This has been done for my company's needs for building custom Query classes which add some behaviour to the base Lucene queries. It prevents multiple unnnecessary casts. I know this introduction is not wanted by the team, but it really makes our developments easier to maintain. If you don't want to use this, replace all /Queriable/ calls with standard /Query/.

1,"IndexWriter memory leak when large docs are indexedSpinoff from the java-user thread ""IndexWriter and memory usage""...

IndexWriter has had a long standing memory leak, since LUCENE-843.

When the byte/char/int blocks are recycled to the common pool, the
per-thread DW classes incorrectly still hold a reference to them.

This normally is not a problem, since these buffers will be re-used
again.

But, if you index a massive document, causing IW to allocate more than
the RAM buffer allocated to it, then the leak happens.  So you could
have a 16 MB RAM buffer set, but if a huge doc required allocation of
200 MB worth of arrays, those 200 MB are never freed (well, until you
close the IW and deref it from the app).

It's even worse if you use multiple threads: if each thread has ever
had to index a massive document, then that thread incorrectly holds
onto the extra arrays.

0,"TestIndexModifier.testIndexWithThreads is not valid?I recently started playing with the trunk of SVN, and noticed that intermitently, TestIndexModifier.testIndexWithThreads (revision 292010) would fail.

The basic premise of the test seems to be that 3 pairs of IndexThread instances can be started in parallel, each pair using the same instance of IndexModifier to concurrently and randomly add/delete/optimize a single FSDirectory index.  
The test is considered a success if the sum of additions-deletions recorded by each pair of threads equals the final docCount() for the IndexModifier instance used by that pair of threads.

Now I freely admit that I'm not 100% familiar with the code for IndexModifier, but at a glance, the basic premise seems to be: 
   a) If method for IndexWriter is called, open it if needed, close the IndexReader first if needed.
   b) if method for IndexReader is called, open it if needed, close the IndexWriter first if needed.

If I'm understnading that correctly, I see no reason to assume this test will pass.  
It seems like there could be plenty of scenerios in which the number of additions-deletions != docCount(). The most trivial example I can think of is:
   1) the first IndexThread instance which has a chance to run adds a document, and optimizes before any other IndexThreads ever open the Directory.
   2) a subsequent pair of IndexThread instances open their IndexModifier instance before any documents are deleted.
   3) the IndexThread instances from #2 do nothing but add documents
...that pair of IndexThreads is now garunteed to have recorded a differnet number of additions then the docCount returned by their IndexModifier.

Am I missing something, or should this test be removed?

Once on disk the files are copied into the CFS format which is basically a unnecessary for some of the files. We can at any time write at least one file directly into the CFS which can save a reasonable amount of IO. For instance stored fields could be written directly during indexing and during a Codec Flush one of the written files can be appended directly. This optimization is a nice sideeffect for lucene indexing itself but more important for DocValues and LUCENE-3216 we could transparently pack per field files into a single file only for docvalues without changing any code once LUCENE-3216 is resolved.

Please change the HttpClient class to allow the configuration of the SO_LINGER

Suggested extension to the interface of the HttpClient class:
- Add method setSoLinger() to set the current setting for SO_LINGER. The method
could accept one argument. A negative value could indicate that the SO_LINGER

- Add method getSoLinger() that returns the current setting for SO_LINGER. A

1,"ObjectConverterImpl.getObject(Session, Class, String) may not resolve mapping correctly for incompletely described mappingsWhen a node is mapped by calling the ObjectConverter.getObject(Session, Class, String) method and no discriminator property is configured the ObjectConverterImpl class tries to find a ""best"" mapping for the effective node. This is done by walking the class descriptor hierarchy starting at the descriptor for the selected class until a mapping for the node type is found.

In case the class descriptor hierarchy is incomplete because an improperly defined class descriptor would actually perfectly map the node but is not declared to extend (or implement) its parent classes/interfaces, the hierarchy walk down will not find the mapping and thus in the end, the originally requested class will be instantiated. If the class is abstract or an interface this of course fails.

If an exact class descriptor for the node type would be looked up directly, the mapping might be found immediately and the class of the descriptor can be verified it actually is assignement compatible with the requested class. If this would fail, we could still walk the hierarchy to see, whether we find another classdescriptor.

To clarify the issue consider the following example of an abstract base class and a concrete extension class with their node types

   AbstractBaseClass maps abstractly to AbstractBaseType
   BaseClass (extends AbstractBaseClass) maps to BaseType ( with supertype AbstractBaseType )

Note, that the BaseClass mapping does not declare to extend the AbstractBaseClass.

When calling ObjectConverterImpl.getObject(session, AbstractBaseClass.class, aBaseTypeNode), the descriptor fore the AbstractBaseClass is inspected agains the node and then it is decided to check the class descriptor hierarchy. Node mapping can be found by walking the hierarchy and hence the AbstractBaseClass is instantiated, which of course fails.

If the BaseClass mapping would be declared as extending the AbstractBaseClass mapping, everything would be fine."

1,"ConnectException not handled in DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandlerCopied from my mailing list post, Oleg suggested I post it to JIRA for 4.0 fix.

i am using commons-httpclient.3.0.1 and I am sending some requests
through https protocol. I have a problem with a long creation of
connection if ip address of remote service is not existing. I think
problem is in the situation when https connection is not created and
ConnectException is thrown after connection timeout. This exception is
catched in HttpMethodDirector.java in method executeWithRetry. Then
the DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler is called to recognize whether
connection creation will be repeated or not.
I think, that special handling for ConnectException is missing in
retryMethod of DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler, because exception is not
recognized and connetions are created again.
On the other hand, ConnectTimeoutException is thrown after connection
timeout for HTTP. This exception is handled in
DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler and call is stopped.

These lines of code handle ConnectTimeoutException in retryMethod of
DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler:
if (exception instanceof InterruptedIOException) {
            // Timeout
            return false;
        }

Probably this is missing for ConnectException:
if (exception instanceof InterruptedIOException || exception
instanceof ConnectException) {

            return false;

With the following configuration:
<Cluster id=""node1"" syncDelay=""10"">
    <Journal class=""org.apache.jackrabbit.core.journal.JNDIDatabaseJournal"">
      <param name=""schema"" value=""oracle"" />

jackrabbit crashes at startup with a not well defined sql error. Investigating on the problem I see that the ""oracle.ddl"" file contains a ""tablespace"" variable that is replaced only by the OracleDatabaseJournal implementation.

As a workaround users can create a different ddl without a tablespace variable, but this should probably work better out of the box.

WDYT about one of the following solutions?
- make the base DatabaseJournal implementation support jndi datasource just like PersistenceManagers do (without a specific configuration property but specifying a jndi location in the url property)
- move the replacement of the tablespace variable (and maybe: add a generic replacement of *any* parameter found in the databaseJournal configuration) to the main DatabaseJournal implementation. This could be handy and it will make the OracleDatabaseJournal extension useless, but I see that at the moment there can be a problem with the MsSql implementation, since it adds ""on "" to the tablespace name only when it's not set to an empty string.

0,"[PATCH] Decouple locking implementation from Directory implementationThis is a spinoff of http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-305.

I've opened this new issue to capture that it's wider scope than
LUCENE-305.

This is a patch originally created by Jeff Patterson (see above link)
and then modified as described here:

  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-305#action_12418493

with some small additional changes:

  * For each FSDirectory.getDirectory(), I made a corresponding
    version that also accepts a LockFactory instance.  So, you can
    construct an FSDirectory with your own LockFactory.

  * Cascaded defaulting for FSDirectory's LockFactory implementation:
    if you pass in a LockFactory instance, it's used; else if
    setDisableLocks was called, we use NoLockFactory; else, if the
    system property ""org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectoryLockFactoryClass""
    is defined, we use that; finally, we'll use the original locking
    implementation (SimpleFSLockFactory).

The gist is that all locking code has been moved out of *Directory and
into subclasses of a new abstract LockFactory class.  You can now set
the LockFactory of a Directory to change how it does locking.  For
example, you can create an FSDirectory but set its locking to
SingleInstanceLockFactory (if you know all writing/reading will take
place a single JVM).

The changes pass all unit tests (on Ubuntu Linux Sun Java 1.5 and
Windows XP Sun Java 1.4), and I added another TestCase to test the
LockFactory code.

Note that LockFactory defaults are not changed: FSDirectory defaults
to SimpleFSLockFactory and RAMDirectory defaults to
SingleInstanceLockFactory.

Next step (separate issue) is to create a LockFactory that uses the OS
native locks (through java.nio).

0,"SystemSession#createSession should return SessionImpl againa long with the fix of  JCR-2890 (revision 1089436) the behavior of SystemSession#createSession has changed to
return a SystemSession instead of SessionImpl as it used to be.

while i basically consider this move to be correct and the better way of dealing with that session-cloning
mechanism as it prevents the user of this method to convert a SystemSession into a regular session
for extra writing operations (such as e.g. access control editing that is not supported with the
system session to prevent chicken-egg-problems on repo startup).

therefore i would like to revert that change for the 2.4 release in order to prevent regressions.

for the time after 2.4 i would however suggest that we finally take the time to clearly define the
usages, abilities and responsibilities of the system session and also review how and where we
expose them to the individual 'modules' of jackrabbit core..  i started working on this but decided
that this is definitely too risky for 2.4 whereas reverting the change mentioned above should
imo impose very limited risk as all usages of those sessions i am aware of use them as ""Session""
or ""SesssionImpl"", most of them not even having access to the SystemSession class."

Implementations of the API can then do arbitrary things like save away
the field's size, load the field, clone the IndexInput for later lazy
loading, etc.

This very thin API would be a mirror image of the very thin index time
API we now have (IndexableField) and, importantly, it would have no
dependence on our ""user space"" Document/Field/FieldType impl, so apps
are free to do something totally custom.

After we have this, we should build the ""sugar"" API that rebuilds a
Document instance (ie IR.document(int docID)) on top of this new thin
API.  This'll also be a good test that the API is sufficient.

0,"Support system properties in ${...} vars in XML config filesThe variable replacement (${...}) in config files like repository.xml currently only allows for the special variables introduced by Jackrabbit, eg. ${wsp.name} or ${rep.home}. But it would be useful to support all java system properties here as it is some kind of a standard in Java XML config files (see Spring for an example).

This makes it easier to inject variables from outside the config file, eg. by setting them on the command line or injecting them programmatically in test cases. Typical parameters for that include database connection credentials, which one wants to avoid to put into repository.xml files that are often checked into SVN.

This is especially true for test cases, eg. I currently work on a persistence manager component and I want to include the repository.xml in the source tree (under applications/test) but without my specific credentials. These are applied by loading a user-specific properties file through the test case before the repository is started and the config is read.

possibly stress the IO system eg if merges, searching are also
fighting for IO.

0,"QueryParser throws new exceptions even if custom parsing logic threw a better oneWe have subclassed QueryParser and have various custom fields.  When these fields contain invalid values, we throw a subclass of ParseException which has a more useful message (and also a localised message.)

Problem is, Lucene's QueryParser is doing this:

{code}
    catch (ParseException tme) {
        // rethrow to include the original query:
        throw new ParseException(""Cannot parse '"" +query+ ""': "" + tme.getMessage());
    }
{code}

Thus, our nice and useful ParseException is thrown away, replaced by one with no information about what's actually wrong with the query (it does append getMessage() but that isn't localised.  And it also throws away the underlying cause for the exception.)

I am about to patch our copy to simply remove these four lines; the caller knows what the query string was (they have to have a copy of it because they are passing it in!) so having it in the error message itself is not useful.  Furthermore, when the query string is very big, what the user wants to know is not that the whole query was bad, but which part of it was bad.

3. TrecDocMaker was added - it reads as input the .gz files used in Trec - e.g. .gov data - this can be handy to benchmark Lucene on these large collections.  Similar to the Reuters collection, the doc-maker scans the input directory for all the files and extracts documents from the files.  Here there are multiple documents in each input file. Unlike the Reuters collection, we cannot provide a 'loader' for these collections - they are available from http://trec.nist.gov - for research purposes.

There is also lots of code that just converts UUIDs to NodeIds and vice versa. We could simplify such code if we just used NodeId everywhere.

Also, we might want to open up the possibility of using non-UUID node identifiers at some point in future, so it would make a lot of sense to remove the NodeId.getUUID method and rely directly on NodeId and it's equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods in many places where we currently use UUIDs."
0,"Change default write lock file location to index directory (not java.io.tmpdir)Now that readers are read-only, we no longer need to store lock files
in a different global lock directory than the index directory.  This
has been a source of confusion and caused problems to users in the
past.

Furthermore, once the write lock is stored in the index directory, it
no longer needs the big digest prefix that was previously required
to make sure lock files in the global lock directory, from different
indexes, did not conflict.

This way, all files related to an index will appear in a single
directory.  And you can easily list that directory to see if a
""write.lock"" is present to check whether a writer is open on the
index.

Note that this change just affects how FSDirectory creates its default
lockFactory if no lockFactory was specified.  It is still possible
(just no longer the default) to pick a different directory to store
your lock files by pre-instantiating your own LockFactory.

As part of this I would like to remove LOCK_DIR and the no-argument
constructor, in SimpleFSLockFactory and NativeFSLockFactory.  I don't
think we should have the notion of a global default lock directory
anymore.  This is actually an API change.  However, neither
SimpleFSLockFactory nor NativeFSLockFactory haver been released yet,
so I think this API removal is allowed?

Finally I want to deprecate (but not yet remove, because this has been
in the API for many releases) the static LOCK_DIR that's in
FSDirectory.  But it's now entirely unused.

0,"Allow customizing/subclassing of DirectoryReaderDirectoryReader is final and has only static factory methods. It is not possible to subclass it in any way.

The problem is mainly Solr, as Solr accesses directory(), IndexCommits,... and therefore cannot work on abstract IndexReader anymore. This should be changed, by e.g. handling reopening in the IRFactory, also versions, commits,... Currently its not possible to implement any other IRFactory that returns something else.

On the other hand, it should be possible to ""wrap"" a DirectoryReader / CompositeReader to handle filtering of collection based information (subreaders, reopening hooks,...). This can be done by making DirectoryReader abstract and let DirectoryReader.open return a internal hidden class ""StandardDirectoryReader"". This is similar to the relatinship between IndexReader and hidden DirectoryReader in the past.

DirectoryReader will have final implementations of most methods like getting document stored fields, global docFreq and other statistics, but allows hooking into doOpenIfChanged. Also it should not be limited to SegmentReaders as childs - any AtomicReader is fine. This allows users to create e.g. a Directory-based ParallelReader (see LUCENE-3736) that supports reopen and (partially commits)."

Proposals:

- drop JDK 1.4 support
- tune the JCR2SPI handler to create namespace attributes when needed
- use an entirely different serializer

My personal preference would be just to drop JDK 1.4 support, but that may not be acceptable for everyone.

we can use the fact that these enums allow attributes to keep the reuse information for both so it can reuse when stepping through terms.

0,"ConstantScoreQuery should directly support wrapping Query and simply strip off scoresEspecially in MultiTermQuery rewrite modes we often simply need to strip off scores from Queries and make them constant score. Currently the code to do this looks quite ugly: new ConstantScoreQuery(new QueryWrapperFilter(query))

As the name says, QueryWrapperFilter should make any other Query constant score, so why does it not take a Query as ctor param? This question was aldso asked quite often by my customers and is simply correct, if you think about it.

Looking closer into the code, it is clear that this would also speed up MTQs:
- One additional wrapping and method calls can be removed
- Maybe we can even deprecate QueryWrapperFilter in 3.1 now (it's now only used in tests and the use-case for this class is not really available) and LUCENE-2831 does not need the stupid hack to make Simon's assertions pass
- CSQ now supports out-of-order scoring and topLevel scoring, so a CSQ on top-level now directly feeds the Collector. For that a small trick is used: The score(Collector) calls are directly delegated and the scores are stripped by wrapping the setScorer() method in Collector

During that I found a visibility bug in Scorer (LUCENE-2839): The method ""boolean score(Collector collector, int max, int firstDocID)"" should be public not protected, as its not solely intended to be overridden by subclasses and is called from other classes, too! This leads to no compiler bugs as the other classes that calls it is mainly BooleanScorer(2) and thats in same package, but visibility is wrong. I will open an issue for that and fix it at least in trunk where we have no backwards-requirement."
0,"Set default precisionStep for NumericField and NumericRangeFilterThis is a spinoff from LUCENE-1701.

A user using Numeric* should not need to understand what's
""under the hood"" in order to do their indexing & searching.

They should be able to simply:
{code}
doc.add(new NumericField(""price"", 15.50);
{code}

And have a decent default precisionStep selected for them.

Actually, if we add ctors to NumericField for each of the supported
types (so the above code works), we can set the default per-type.  I
think we should do that?

4 for int and 6 for long was proposed as good defaults.

The default need not be ""perfect"", as advanced users can always
optimize their precisionStep, and for users experiencing slow
RangeQuery performance, NumericRangeQuery with any of the defaults we
are discussing will be much faster.

0,"Internal Timeout Handling in the TransactionContext is not XA Spec. conformThe problem here is that in a 2 phase transaction the xa spec does not  
permit a RB* return code in response to xa_commit().  The xa spec says  
the following about RB* return codes in the xa_commit() section:        
                                                                        
""The resource manager did not commit the work done on behalf of the     
transaction branch.  Upon return, the resource manager has rolled back  
the branch?s work and has released all held resources.  These values may
be returned only if TMONEPHASE is set in flags""                         
                                                                        
Essentially, the only two return codes from xa_commit that J2EE Containers can     
handle sensibly are XA_OK (normal case) and XA_RMFAIL.  RMFAIL will     
cause the containers to retry to commit the  transaction.  Any other return code will result in a heuristic          
transaction outcome (non-atomic).  

In a xa environment the TMONEPHASE is not set on the flags and so XA_RBTIMEOUT is 
not a permitted return code. A Container  transaction service cannot do anything to ensure an atomic     
outcome if an XAResource fails to honour its promise to be able to commit it made when it answer XA_OK in response to xa_prepare(). 

The internal timeout handling will rollback the Jackrabbit XAResource if the time exceeds between prepare and commit.
and in the commit Method will always throw a XA_RBTIMEOUT.

We should not handle the timeout internal because this should make the container in a 2 Phase transaction."

This probably is not what we want. Besides, for non-idempotent methods this may
simply be fatal and result in all sorts of unpleasant side-effects.

One possibilty that I personally favour is to make HttpTimeoutException class
extend IOException instead of HttpRecoverableException. There are others. The
question is whether timeout exceptions should be considered recoverable from the
conseptual standpoint. What do you think?

1,"StandardQueryParser ignores AND operator for tokenized query termsThe standard query parser uses the default query operator for query clauses that are created from tokenization in the query parser instead of the actual operator for the source term.

here is an example:

parser.setDefaultOperator(Operator.OR);
System.out.println(((BooleanQuery)parser.parse(""_deleted:true AND title:東京"", ""f"")));

this should yield:
+_deleted:true +(title:東 title:京)

as our former core query parser does but actually yields:
+_deleted:true title:東 title:京

seems like a bug to me, looking at the tests seems we don't test for this kind of queries in the standard query parser tests too.

0,"UserManagement: membership cache default size too smallThe membership cache that has been introduced in JCR-2703 is making use of an LRUMap to cache group memberships (authorizable nodeId -> group nodeIds). In environments where users belong to more than 100 groups, the cache quickly becomes ineffective due to the default maximum size of the LRUMap.

Once the cache limit is hit, the rather expensive Node#getWeakReferences API calls resulting in search queries are executed again, leading to quite noticeable performance drops. Thus I'd suggest to either make the membership cache configurable or introduce some logic to let the cache grow dynamically as needed (still having some kind of hard limit to avoid memory issues)."

In consequence node is left in locked state. It looks like a bug.
If one thread locked node successfully, then none other can modify it,
and the same thread should release lock without any problems.

Shouldn't be lock operation atomic itself ?

1,"Deadlock in DefaultISMLockingThere seems to be a bug in DefaultISMLocking which was detected as part of JCR-2746.

1) The main thread gets a read lock.

2) The ObservationManager thread tries to lock for writing, which is blocked because there is still a read lock.

3) Then the main thread tries to get a second read lock, which is blocked because there is a waiting write lock.

The bug was introduced as part of JCR-2089 (Use java.util.concurrent), revisions 995411 and 995412. I think the safe solution is to revert those to commits, and add a test case. If the DefaultISMLocking is changed later on, more test cases are required. An efficient solution is relatively complicated.

0,"Collapse Searcher/Searchable/IndexSearcher; remove contrib/remote; merge PMS into IndexSearcherWe've discussed cleaning up our *Searcher stack for some time... I
think we should try to do this before releasing 4.0.

So I'm attaching an initial patch which:

  * Removes Searcher, Searchable, absorbing all their methods into IndexSearcher

  * Removes contrib/remote

  * Removes MultiSearcher

  * Absorbs ParallelMultiSearcher into IndexSearcher (ie you can now
    pass useThreads=true, or a custom ES to the ctor)

The patch is rough -- I just ripped stuff out, did search/replace to
IndexSearcher, etc.  EG nothing is directly testing using threads with
IndexSearcher, but before committing I think we should add a
newSearcher to LuceneTestCase, which randomly chooses whether the
searcher uses threads, and cutover tests to use this instead of making
their own IndexSearcher.

I think MultiSearcher has a useful purpose, but as it is today it's
too low-level, eg it shouldn't be involved in rewriting queries: the
Query.combine method is scary.  Maybe in its place we make a higher
level class, with limited API, that's able to federate search across
multiple IndexSearchers?  It'd also be able to optionally use thread
per IndexSearcher.

Currently jackrabbit-jcr-commons depends on both commons-collections and slf4j-api, but both dependencies are relatively isolated and could be dropped with relatively little effort.

0,"Optimize BlockTermsReader.seekWhen we seek, we first consult the terms index to find the right block
of 32 (default) terms that may hold the target term.  Then, we scan

The scanning just uses next() and then compares the full term, but
this is actually rather wasteful.  First off, since all terms in the
block share a common prefix, we should compare the target against that
common prefix once, and then only compare the new suffix of each
term.  Second, since the term suffixes have already been read up front
into a byte[], we should do a no-copy comparison (vs today, where we
first read a copy into the local BytesRef and then compare).

With this opto, I removed the ability for BlockTermsWriter/Reader to

0,"Collapse nested OR expressionsExecuting a query with multiple OR expressions in a predicate leads to score values that depend on the order of the operands.

For example, the following query:

//*[jcr:contains(@prop1, 'foo') or jcr:contains(@prop2, 'foo') or jcr:contains(@prop3, 'foo')] order by @jcr:score descending

will return a slightly different result compared to:

//*[jcr:contains(@prop3, 'foo') or jcr:contains(@prop1, 'foo') or jcr:contains(@prop2, 'foo')] order by @jcr:score descending

Internally jackrabbit parses the predicate of the first query into a tree:

orExpr(orExpr(contains(prop1, 'foo'), contains(prop2, 'foo')), contains(prop3, 'foo'))

Lucene will calculate the score for the inner OR expression first and then for the outer, which is not equivalent with a nested expression that has property names in a different sequence.

The query should be translated internally into a single OR expression with three operands. That way, the score value is always the same, irrespective of the order of the operands."

was related to the allow-only for groups).

anyway:
while playing around with the permission in our CRX recently i found, that the evaluation of the following setup didn't work as I would
have expected:

- user A is member of group B and C
- for both groups an ACE exists on a given node /a/b/c
- the acl looks like  { deny for B, allow for C }

I would have expected that the allow for C would have reverted the previous deny for B since - in the GUI - I read the ace eval order from first entry to last entry... in the order I added them."

0,"Avoid exceptions thrown in finalize handler of RepositoryImpl constructorIf an exception happens during initialization of the repository, it might be overlayed by an exception thrown in the finalize handler of the RepositoryImpl constructor (see line 382 ff in [1]). The latter exception wins and the original exception is lost (if you don't have a log). This makes it hard to figure out the real problem.

This problem is actually a bit self-enforcing: if something goes wrong during startup, the code in the shutdown() method that is called is actually very prone to fail as it might not expect such a broken-startup state. In my case the overlaying NPE happened in ObservationManagerImpl.getRegisteredEventListeners, where this.dispatcher was unexpectedly null [2].

I think both places should be fixed (NPE guard in ObservationManagerImpl constructor for ""dispatcher"") and a try/catch block in the finalizer, just logging the exception:

0,"terms index should not store useless suffixesThis idea came up when discussing w/ Robert how to improve our terms index...

The terms dict index today simply grabs whatever term was at a 0 mod 128 index (by default).

But this is wasteful because you often don't need the suffix of the term at that point.

EG if the 127th term is aa and the 128th (indexed) term is abcd123456789, instead of storing that full term you only need to store ab.  The suffix is useless, and uses up RAM since we load the terms index into RAM.

The patch is very simple.  The optimization is particularly easy because terms are now byte[] and we sort in binary order.

I tested on first 10M 1KB Wikipedia docs, and this reduces the terms index (tii) file from 3.9 MB -> 3.3 MB = 16% smaller (using StandardAnalyzer, indexing body field tokenized but title / date fields untokenized).  I expect on noisier terms dicts, especially ones w/ bad terms accidentally indexed, that the savings will be even more.

In the future we could do crazier things.  EG there's no real reason why the indexed terms must be regular (every N terms), so, we could instead pick terms more carefully, say ""approximately"" every N, but favor terms that have a smaller net prefix.  We can also index more sparsely in regions where the net docFreq is lowish, since we can afford somewhat higher seek+scan time to these terms since enuming their docs will be much faster."

1,"TransientRepository with LocalFileSystem eventually causes Repository data to be stored at path '/'I'm using a TransitoryRepository for my unit testing, with the repository's file system specified as:

    <FileSystem class=""org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.local.LocalFileSystem"">
        <param name=""path"" value=""${rep.home}/repository""/>
    </FileSystem>

I noticed today that when I run my unit tests Jackrabbit is creating four directories at the root of my hard drive: ""meta"", ""namespaces"", ""nodetypes"", and ""data"". I tracked the problem the fact that when a LocalFileSystem is closed, it sets the ""root"" to null - an invalid state. But when using a TransitoryRepository, the invalid state is never discovered because the LocalFileSystem object itself is not released, or re-initialized. It is simply used to create BasedFileSystem objects in RepositoryImpl. Calls to BasedFileSystem defer to the LocalFileSystem object that now has a null root. Inside the LocalFileSystem, all the calls to Java's io.File constructor have a ""null"" parent parameter, causing File to fall back to its single argument constructor which sees the path ""/meta"" and happily creates files at the root of the disk.

I'm not sure what the best solution is, but some thoughts I've had are:
- don't set the ""root"" property to null when closing a LocalFileSystem
- make RepositoryConfig re-init the FileSystem variable when it is accessed.
- don't cache the RepositoryConfig in TransitoryRepository (this might also require a new constructor that takes a class-path resource for the repository configuration file)"

1,"Check for correct content-type in URLEncodedUtils not working for encoding-suffixesDear DEV-Team,

i am developing an application with the httpclient. Today i found a small problem, related to URLEncodedUtils.

Our Tomcat-Server deliveres for Server-Requests, the HTTP-Header: ""Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8"", but the httpclient only checks for: ""Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded"". This failing check results in an empty result of call to the method: URLEncodedUtils.parse(entity);

Following source-code causes the prob: 

public class URLEncodedUtils {

    /**
     * Returns true if the entity's Content-Type header is
     * <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.
     */
    public static boolean isEncoded (final HttpEntity entity) {
        final Header contentType = entity.getContentType();
        return (contentType != null && contentType.getValue().equalsIgnoreCase(CONTENT_TYPE));
    }
}

IMO the method should be changed to:


public class URLEncodedUtils {

    /**
     * Returns true if the entity's Content-Type header is
     * <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.
     */
    public static boolean isEncoded (final HttpEntity entity) {
        final Header contentType = entity.getContentType();
        return (contentType != null && contentType.getValue().startsWith(CONTENT_TYPE + "";""));
    }
}

0,"Eliminate unnecessary uses of Hashtable and VectorLucene uses Vector, Hashtable and Enumeration when it doesn't need to. Changing to ArrayList and HashMap may provide better performance.

There are a few places Vector shows up in the API. IMHO, List should have been used for parameters and return values.

There are a few distinct usages of these classes:
# internal but with ArrayList or HashMap would do as well. These can simply be replaced.
# internal and synchronization is required. Either leave as is or use a collections synchronization wrapper.
# As a parameter to a method where List or Map would do as well. For contrib, just replace. For core, deprecate current and add new method signature.
# Generated by JavaCC. (All *.jj files.) Nothing to be done here.
# As a base class. Not sure what to do here. (Only applies to SegmentInfos extends Vector, but it is not used in a safe manner in all places. Perhaps, implements List would be better.)
# As a return value from a package protected method, but synchronization is not used. Change return type.
# As a return value to a final method. Change to List or Map.

In using a Vector the following iteration pattern is frequently used.
for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
  Object o = v.elementAt(i);
}

This is an indication that synchronization is unimportant. The list could change during iteration.

0,"SharedFieldCache$StringIndex memory leak causing OOM's SharedFieldCache$StringIndex is not working properly. It is meant to cache the docnumbers in lucene along with the term to sort on. The issue is twofold. I have a solution for the second one, the first one is not really solvable from jr pov, because lucene index readers are already heavily caching Terms. 

Explanation of the problem:

For *each* unique property where is sorted on, a new lucene ScoreDocComparator is created (see SharedFieldComparator newComparator). This new comparator creates *per* lucene indexreader  SharedFieldCache.StringIndex which is stored in a WeakHashMap with as key, the indexreader . As this indexreader  almost *never* can be garbage collected (only if it is merged and thus unused after), the SharedFieldCache.StringIndex are there to be the rest of the jvm life (which is sometime short, as can be seen from the simple unittest attached).  Obviously, this results pretty fast in OOM.

1) issue one:  The cached terms[] in SharedFieldCache.StringIndex can become huge when you sort on a common property (date) which is present in a lot of nodes. It you sort on large properties, like 'title' this SharedFieldCache.StringIndex  will quickly use hundreds of Mb for a couple of hundred of thousand of nodes with a title. This issue is already a lucene issue, as lucene already caches the terms. OTOH, I really doubt whether we should index long string values as UNTOKENIZED in lucene at all. A half working solution might be a two-step solution, where the first sort is on the first 10 chars, and only if the comparator returns 0, take the entire string to sort on

2) issue two:  The cached terms[] in SharedFieldCache.StringIndex is frequently sparse, consuming an incredible amount of memory for string arrays containing mainly null values. For example (see attached unit test):

- add 1.000.000 nodes
- do a query and sort on a non existing property
- you'll loose 1.000.000 * 4 bytes ~ 4 Mb of memory
- sort on another non existing prop : another 4 Mb is lost
- do it 100 times --> 400 Mb is lost, and can't be reclaimed

I'll attach a solution which works really fine for me, still having the almost unavoidable memory absorption, but makes it much smaller. The solution is, that if < 10% of the String array is filled, i consider the array already sparse, and move to a HashMap solution. Performance does not decrease much (and in case of large sparsity increases because less memory consumption --> less gc, etc). 

Perhaps it does not seem to be a common issue (certainly the unit test) but our production environments memory snapshots indicate most memory being held by the SharedFieldCache$StringIndex (and the lucene Terms, which is harder to avoid)

I'd like to see this in the 1.5.1 if others are ok with it


"
0,"MultipartPostMethod does not check for error messagesIf a MultipartPost request is sent to a server which requires authentication, 
the server may respond to the request with an unauthorized header and close the 
connection before all of the data is sent.  HttpClient should monitor the 
incoming stream and cease transmitting the body if an error message is received 
(section 8.2.2 of rfc2616, see below).

At the very least HttpClient should check for a response when catching the 
HttpRecoverableException and retrying.  This probably should be done in 
HttpMethodBase so that we are in a known state when starting to retry the 
connection (ie: there isn't an existing response in the socket buffer to cause 
problems).

Ideally, HttpClient should also implement the 100 (Continue) status as 
specified in section 8.2.3 of rfc2616.

Finally, PostMethod should be tested to ensure that it does not exhibit this 
bug as well.

-------------
8.2.2 Monitoring Connections for Error Status Messages

   An HTTP/1.1 (or later) client sending a message-body SHOULD monitor
   the network connection for an error status while it is transmitting
   the request. If the client sees an error status, it SHOULD
   immediately cease transmitting the body. If the body is being sent
   using a ""chunked"" encoding (section 3.6), a zero length chunk and
   empty trailer MAY be used to prematurely mark the end of the message.
   If the body was preceded by a Content-Length header, the client MUST
   close the connection."

0,"Add a waitForMerges() method to IndexWriterIt would be very useful to have a waitForMerges() method on the IndexWriter.

Right now, the only way i can see to achieve this is to call IndexWriter.close()

ideally, there would be a method on the IndexWriter to wait for merges without actually closing the index.
This would make it so that background merges (or optimize) can be waited for without closing the IndexWriter, and then reopening a new IndexWriter

the close() reopen IndexWriter method can be problematic if the close() fails as the write lock won't be released
this could then result in the following sequence:
* close() - fails
* force unlock the write lock (per close() documentation)
* new IndexWriter() (acquires write lock)
* finalize() on old IndexWriter releases the write lock
* Index is now not locked, and another IndexWriter pointing to the same directory could be opened

If you don't force unlock the write lock, opening a new IndexWriter will fail until garbage collection calls finalize() the old IndexWriter

If the waitForMerges() method is available, i would likely never need to close() the IndexWriter until right before the process being shutdown, so this issue would not occur (worst case scenario, the waitForMerges() fails)

0,"Optimization for FieldDocSortedHitQueueWhen updating core for generics,  I found the following as a optimization of FieldDocSortedHitQueue:

All FieldDoc values are Compareables (also the score or docid, if they
appear as SortField in a MultiSearcher or ParallelMultiSearcher). The code
of lessThan seems very ineffective, as it has a big switch statement on the
SortField type, then casts the value to the underlying numeric type Object,
calls Number.xxxValue() & co for it and then compares manually. As
j.l.Number is itself Comparable, I see no reason to do this. Just call
compareTo on the Comparable interface and we are happy. The big deal is that
it prevents casting and the two method calls xxxValue(), as Number.compareTo
works more efficient internally.

The only special cases are String sort, where the Locale may be used and the
score sorting which is backwards. But these are two if statements instead of
the whole switch.

I had not tested it now for performance, but in my opinion it should be
faster for MultiSearchers. All tests still pass (because they should).

0,"Deprecating StopAnalyzer ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS - General replacement with an immutable SetStopAnalyzer and StandartAnalyzer are using the static final array ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS by default in various places. Internally this array is converted into a mutable set which looks kind of weird to me. 
I think the way to go is to deprecate all use of the static final array and replace it with an immutable implementation of CharArraySet. Inside an analyzer it does not make sense to have a mutable set anyway and we could prevent set creation each time an analyzer is created. In the case of an immutable set we won't have multithreading issues either. 
in essence we get rid of a fair bit of ""converting string array to set"" code, do not have a PUBLIC static reference to an array (which is mutable) and reduce the overhead of analyzer creation.

let me know what you think and I create a patch for it.

1,"DateUtil#formatDate uses default locale instead of USProblem reported by Yannick <yannick at meudal.net> on the httpclient-user list

==================================================================
Hello,

This is a bug report.

I'm using Commons HTTPClient (rc2) for generating HTTP requests. I put in 
headers some specific header, like the If-Modified-Since attribute. 
When I generate the date through DateUtil.formatDate method, I get a 
localized date, in french. Example: 
If-Modified-Since: dim., 10 avr. 2005 05:04:08 CEST

I get problems on my http server during parsing the received date. This is 
not a RFC 2616 compliant date format. It should be:
If-Modified-Since: Sun, 10 Apr 2005 05:04:08 CEST

A patch should be applied, by creating a new SimpleDateFormat(pattern, 
Locale.US) instead of SimpleDateFormat(pattern) (like it is done in the 
parse method, line #159).

org.apache.commons.httpclient.util.DateUtil, line #205:

    public static String formatDate(Date date, String pattern) {
        if (date == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException(""date is 
null"");
        if (pattern == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException(""pattern 
is null"");
 
        SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(pattern, 
Locale.US);
        return formatter.format(date);
    }

1,"String properties with invalid XML characters export as invalid XMLAs noted in the current JCR 1.0.1 maintenance draft, sections 6.4.1,
6.4.2.6, XML export of string properties that contain invalid XML
characters isn't well-defined currently, since those characters are
not permissible in XML.  The proposed fix is to use base64
encoding for such values in System View.

Most characters below #x20 are examples of this.  Currently, these
are escaped numerically in output (such as (amp)#0; )  but
such escape sequences can't be parsed by the XML
import methods.

The current behavior is particularly problematic, because the user
doesn't know the output is corrupt until later, when they try to import it
and get InvalidSerializedDataException.

If for some reason the base64 option is delayed, it might
make sense, as an interim solution, to fail on export
or to somehow patch import to relax its parsing and allow
these escape codes."

0,"Change defaults in IndexWriter to maximize ""out of the box"" performanceThis is follow-through from LUCENE-845, LUCENE-847 and LUCENE-870;
I'll commit this once those three are committed.

Out of the box performance of IndexWriter is maximized when flushing
by RAM instead of a fixed document count (the default today) because
documents can vary greatly in size.

Likewise, merging performance should be faster when merging by net
segment size since, to minimize the net IO cost of merging segments
over time, you want to merge segments of equal byte size.

Finally, ConcurrentMergeScheduler improves indexing speed
substantially (25% in a simple initial test in LUCENE-870) because it
runs the merges in the backround and doesn't block
add/update/deleteDocument calls.  Most machines have concurrency
between CPU and IO and so it makes sense to default to this
MergeScheduler.

Note that these changes will break users of ParallelReader because the
parallel indices will no longer have matching docIDs.  Such users need
to switch IndexWriter back to flushing by doc count, and switch the
MergePolicy back to LogDocMergePolicy.  It's likely also necessary to
switch the MergeScheduler back to SerialMergeScheduler to ensure
deterministic docID assignment.

I think the combination of these three default changes, plus other
performance improvements for indexing (LUCENE-966, LUCENE-843,
LUCENE-963, LUCENE-969, LUCENE-871, etc.) should make for some sizable
performance gains Lucene 2.3!"

You are basically right hands down. It does make sense for the HTTP version

Subject: isHttp11 and HTTP/1.0 servers 


The boolean variable http11 is set on a method by method basis. For PutMethod, 
decisions (eg. Expect: 100-continue request header) are made prior to 
determining the value for Http11 (chicken and egg problem) and so the default 
(true) is used to produce the request. An HTTP/1.0 server hangs waiting for 
the extra data on the PUT method body. 

For applications that are using HttpClient (ie. they do not manipulate the 
HTTP methods directly and cannot be expected to set the value of Http11 for 
each method instance), shouldn't http11 have HttpClient scope ? This would 
allow an interaction (eg. OPTIONS) to set http11 and all methods thereafter 
would use this setting?

This default value does not make sense anymore because index merges are performed in a background thread and may take a long time without an effect on regular workspace operations.

1,"IndexReader.open(String|File) may incorrectly throw AlreadyClosedExceptionSpinoff from here:

    http://www.nabble.com/Runtime-exception-when-creating-IndexSearcher-to20226279.html

If you open an IndexSearcher/Reader, passing in String or File, then
closeDirectory is set to true in the reader.

If the index has a single segment, then SegmentReader.get is used to
open the index.  If an IOException is hit in there, the SegmentReader
closes itself and then closes the directory since closeDirectory is
true.

The problem is, the retry logic in SegmentInfos (to look for another
segments_N to try) kicks in and hits an AlreadyClosedException,
masking the original root cause.

Workaround is to separately get the Directory using
FSDirectory.getDirectory, and then instantiate IndexSearcher/Reader
from that.

This manifests as masking the root cause of a corrupted single-segment
index with a confusing AlreadyClosedException.  You could also hit
the false exception if the writer was in the process of committing
(ie, a retry was really needed) or if there is some transient IO
problem opening the index (eg too many open files).

0,"Synchronization bottleneck in FieldSortedHitQueue with many concurrent readersThe below is from a post by (my colleague) Paul Smith to the java-users list:

Hi ho peoples.

We have an application that is internationalized, and stores data from many languages (each project has it's own index, mostly aligned with a single language, maybe 2).

Anyway, I've noticed during some thread dumps diagnosing some performance issues, that there appears to be a _potential_ synchronization bottleneck using Locale-based sorting of Strings.  I don't think this problem is the root cause of our performance problem, but I thought I'd mention it here.  Here's the stack dump of a thread waiting:

.....

In our case we had 12 threads waiting like this, while one thread had the lock on the RuleBasedCollator.  Turns out RuleBasedCollator's.compare(...) method is synchronized.  I wonder if a ThreadLocal based collator would be better here... ?  There doesn't appear to be a reason for other threads searching the same index to wait on this sort.  Be just as easy to use their own.  (Is RuleBasedCollator a ""heavy"" object memory wise?  Wouldn't have thought so, per thread)

Thoughts?

1,"AccessManager + CachingHierarchyManager problemThe problem we have is the implementation of the CachingHierarchyManager,
to which the SimpleAccessManager holds a reference.

Let's consider following example:
i add 3 subnodes (a,b,c) to a node and after that i reorder b and c ..
so i have a,c,b. in the process of reordering (using the function
orderBefore of javax.jcr.Node) our AccessManager is called several times to check the permissions of the nodes. In this AccessManager we use some
functions of the CachingHierarchyManager, f.ex.

Path itemPath = hierMgr.getPath(id);
return itemPath.denotesRoot();

or

Path itemPath = hierMgr.getPath(itemId);
Path parentPath = itemPath.getAncestor(1);
return hierMgr.resolvePath(parentPath);

the problem is, that when calling the methods of the
CachingHierarchyManager the nodes i ask for will be cached in the idCache in a wrong state (i. e.: before actually reordering the elements).
so if i want f.ex. delete the node b after reordering, the node will
be looked up in the idCache. in the cache the index of node b is still 2
(actually it should be 3) and so the wrong node will be deleted! "
0,"read/write .del as d-gaps when the deleted bit vector is sufficiently sparse.del file of a segment maintains info on deleted documents in that segment. The file exists only for segments having deleted docs, so it does not exists for newly created segments (e.g. resulted from merge). Each time closing an index reader that deleted any document, the .del file is rewritten. In fact, since the lock-less commits change a new (generation of) .del file is created in each such occasion.

For small indexes there is no real problem with current situation. But for very large indexes, each time such an index reader is closed, creating such new bit-vector seems like unnecessary overhead in cases that the bit vector is sparse (just a few docs were deleted). For instance, for an index with a segment of 1M docs, the sequence: {open reader; delete 1 doc from that segment; close reader;} would write a file of ~128KB. Repeat this sequence 8 times: 8 new files of total size of 1MB are written to disk.

Whether this is a bottleneck or not depends on the application deletes pattern, but for the case that deleted docs are sparse, writing just the d-gaps would save space and time. 

I have this (simple) change to BitVector running and currently trying some performance tests to, yet, convince myself on the worthiness of this.

1,"IndexWriter does not release its write lock when trying to open an index which does not yet existIn version 2.0.0, the private IndexWriter constructor does not properly remove its write lock in the event of an error. This can be seen when one attempts to open (not create) an index in a directory which exists, but in which there is no segments file. Here is the offending code:

    247   private IndexWriter(Directory d, Analyzer a, final boolean create, boolean closeDir)
    248     throws IOException {
    249       this.closeDir = closeDir;
    250       directory = d;
    251       analyzer = a;
    252 
    253       Lock writeLock = directory.makeLock(IndexWriter.WRITE_LOCK_NAME);
    254       if (!writeLock.obtain(writeLockTimeout)) // obtain write lock
    255         throw new IOException(""Index locked for write: "" + writeLock);
    256       this.writeLock = writeLock;                   // save it
    257 
    258       synchronized (directory) {        // in- & inter-process sync
    259         new Lock.With(directory.makeLock(IndexWriter.COMMIT_LOCK_NAME), commitLockTimeout) {
    260             public Object doBody() throws IOException {
    261               if (create)
    262                 segmentInfos.write(directory);
    263               else
    264                 segmentInfos.read(directory);
    265               return null;
    266             }
    267           }.run();
    268       }
    269   }

On line 254, a write lock is obtained by the constructor. If an exception is raised inside the doBody() method (on line 260), then that exception is propagated, the constructor will fail, but the lock is not released until the object is garbage collected. This is typically an issue except when using the IndexModifier class.

As of the filing of this bug, this has not yet been fixed in the trunk (IndexWriter.java#472959):

    251   private IndexWriter(Directory d, Analyzer a, final boolean create, boolean closeDir)
    252     throws IOException {
    253       this.closeDir = closeDir;
    254       directory = d;
    255       analyzer = a;
    256 
    257       Lock writeLock = directory.makeLock(IndexWriter.WRITE_LOCK_NAME);
    258       if (!writeLock.obtain(writeLockTimeout)) // obtain write lock
    259         throw new IOException(""Index locked for write: "" + writeLock);
    260       this.writeLock = writeLock;                   // save it
    261 
    262       synchronized (directory) {        // in- & inter-process sync
    263         new Lock.With(directory.makeLock(IndexWriter.COMMIT_LOCK_NAME), commitLockTimeout) {
    264             public Object doBody() throws IOException {
    265               if (create)
    266                 segmentInfos.write(directory);
    267               else
    268                 segmentInfos.read(directory);

1,"CacheBehaviour Observation brokenWhile trying to fix JCR-2293 I discovered that CacheBehaviour Observation is broken:

- HierarchyEventListener.onEvent ignores local event (despite the comment saying otherwise). Not sure which way it should be. However with local events being ignored, JCR-2293 will most probably also occur with CacheBehaviour Observation. 

- NodeEntryImpl.refresh(Event) does not set its child node entries to incomplete when a node/property was added.

- After tentatively fixing above issues, I discovered that NodeEntryImpl.refresh(Event) and my own event listener operate on different NodeEntryImpl and ChildNodeEntryImpl instances. That is, even though I set childNodeEntries.complete to false in NodeEntryImpl.refresh(Event), when my own event listener retrieves that node (entry), it gets a different instance which has childNodeEntries.complete still set to true.

I suggest to check whether the underlying implementation provides its own node type for jcr:content and use that one. If not, default to nt:unstructured."

Those field number conflicts will remain until those segments are merged and we stabilize again based on the IW global field numbers.

0,"Optimize concurrent queriesThere are a number of bottlenecks that prevent scalability of concurrent queries:

- Fake norms are created repeatedly because a new SearchIndex$CombinedIndexReader is created for each query. This prevents caching of fake norms on the level of the CombinedIndexReader. Creating fake norms for index readers that span multiple sub reader is inefficient and should be avoided. Like with other Jackrabbit specific queries, there should be one for TermQuery, which is aware of sub readers. Its weight should then create one scorer for each sub reader. This effectively reuses the fake norms on the sub reader.

- There should be a  UUID cache that maps document number to UUID. This is basically the inverse of the existing DocNumberCache. UUID lookup is regularly a bottleneck in the SegmentReader where the method document() is synchronized and does I/O.

- Queries often contain constraints that limit the result to nodes with a certain flag set to a literal. These constraints should be cached in the query handler."

0,[PATCH] don't use the reflective form of {Collection}.toArrayPassing a prototype array into {Collection}.toArray that is too small makes the toArray call expend alot of effort using reflection to do it's job. It is more performant to just pass in a correctly sized prototype. This patch does this.
1,"derelativizing of relative URIs with a scheme is incorrectURI constructor ""public URI(URI base, URI relative) throws URIException"" assumes that if given 'relative' URI has a scheme, it should provide an authority and complete path to the constructed URI. However, a URI can have a scheme but still be relative, requiring the authority and base path of the 'base' URI. 

Demonstration code:

URI base = new URI(""http://www.example.com/some/page"");
URI rel = new URI(""http:boo"");
URI derel = new URI(base,rel);
derel.toString();
(java.lang.String) http:boo

In fact, derel should be ""http://www.example.com/some/boo"". 

RFC2396 is a little confused about this; section 3.1 states """"Relative URI references are distinguished from absolute URI in that they do not begin with a scheme name."" But, in section 5, there are several sentences talking about relative URIs that begin with schemes (and how this prevents using relative URIs that have leading path segments that look like scheme identifiers). 

RFC3896, which supercedes RFC2396, removes the implication a relative URI cannot begin with a scheme, leaving the other text explcitly discussing relative URIs with schemes. 

Both Firefox (1.5) and IE (6.0) treat ""http:boo"" the same as ""boo"" for purposes of derelativization against an HTTP base URI, which would give the final URI ""http://www.example.com/some/boo"" in the example above. 

Even relative URIs like ""http:../../boo"" are explicitly legal.

0,"Multi-level skipping on posting listsTo accelerate posting list skips (TermDocs.skipTo(int)) Lucene uses skip lists. 
The default skip interval is set to 16. If we want to skip e. g. 100 documents, 
then it is not necessary to read 100 entries from the posting list, but only 
100/16 = 6 skip list entries plus 100%16 = 4 entries from the posting list. This 
speeds up conjunction (AND) and phrase queries significantly.

However, the skip interval is always a compromise. If you have a very big index 
with huge posting lists and you want to skip over lets say 100k documents, then 
it is still necessary to read 100k/16 = 6250 entries from the skip list. For big 
indexes the skip interval could be set to a higher value, but then after a big 
skip a long scan to the target doc might be necessary.

A solution for this compromise is to have multi-level skip lists that guarantee a 
logarithmic amount of skips to any target in the posting list. This patch 
implements such an approach in the following way:

  Example for skipInterval = 3:
                                                      c            (skip level 2)
                  c                 c                 c            (skip level 1) 
      x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x      (skip level 0)
  d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d  (posting list)
      3     6     9     12    15    18    21    24    27    30     (df)
 
  d - document
  x - skip data
  c - skip data with child pointer
 
Skip level i contains every skipInterval-th entry from skip level i-1. Therefore the 
number of entries on level i is: floor(df / ((skipInterval ^ (i + 1))).
 
Each skip entry on a level i>0 contains a pointer to the corresponding skip entry in 
list i-1. This guarantees a logarithmic amount of skips to find the target document.


Implementations details:

   * I factored the skipping code out of SegmentMerger and SegmentTermDocs to 
     simplify those classes. The two new classes AbstractSkipListReader and 
	 AbstractSkipListWriter implement the skipping functionality.
   * While AbstractSkipListReader and Writer take care of writing and reading the 
     multiple skip levels, they do not implement an actual skip data format. The two 
	 new subclasses DefaultSkipListReader and Writer implement the skip data format 
	 that is currently used in Lucene (with two file pointers for the freq and prox 
	 file and with payload length information). I added this extra layer to be 
	 prepared for flexible indexing and different posting list formats. 
      
   
File format changes: 

   * I added the new parameter 'maxSkipLevels' to the term dictionary and increased the
     version of this file. If maxSkipLevels is set to one, then the format of the freq 
	 file does not change at all, because we only have one skip level as before. For 
	 backwards compatibility maxSkipLevels is set to one automatically if an index 
	 without the new parameter is read. 
   * In case maxSkipLevels > 1, then the frq file changes as follows:
     FreqFile (.frq) --> <TermFreqs, SkipData>^TermCount
	 SkipData        --> <<SkipLevelLength, SkipLevel>^(Min(maxSkipLevels, 
	                       floor(log(DocFreq/log(skipInterval))) - 1)>, SkipLevel>
	 SkipLevel       --> <SkipDatum>^DocFreq/(SkipInterval^(Level + 1))

	 Remark: The length of the SkipLevel is not stored for level 0, because 1) it is not 
	 needed, and 2) the format of this file does not change for maxSkipLevels=1 then.
	 
	 
All unit tests pass with this patch."

0,"Tokenizers (which are the source of Tokens) should call AttributeSource.clearAttributes() firstThis is a followup for LUCENE-1796:
{quote}
Token.clear() used to be called by the consumer... but then it was switched to the producer here: LUCENE-1101 
I don't know if all of the Tokenizers in lucene were ever changed, but in any case it looks like at least some of these bugs were introduced with the switch to the attribute API - for example StandardTokenizer did clear it's reusableToken... and now it doesn't.
{quote}

As alternative to changing all core/contrib Tokenizers to call clearAttributes first, we could do this in the indexer, what would be a overhead for old token streams that itsself clear their reusable token. This issue should also update the Javadocs, to clearly state inside Tokenizer.java, that the source TokenStream (normally the Tokenizer) should clear *all* Attributes. If it does not do it and e.g. the positionIncrement is changed to 0 by any TokenFilter, but the filter does not change it back to 1, the TokenStream would stay with 0. If the TokenFilter would call PositionIncrementAttribute.clear() (because he is responsible), it could also break the TokenStream, because clear() is a general method for the whole attribute instance. If e.g. Token is used as AttributeImpl, a call to clear() would also clear offsets and termLength, which is not wanted. So the source of the Tokenization should rest the attributes to default values.

LUCENE-1796 removed the iterator creation cost, so clearAttributes should run fast, but is an additional cost during Tokenization, as it was not done consistently before, so a small speed degradion is caused by this, but has nothing to do with the new TokenStream API."

This originally was added for LUCENE-1282, ie, as a safety to catch the nasty ""off by 1"" JRE hotspot bug that would otherwise silently corrupt the index.

However, this check also seems to catch a different case, where the size of the file is zero.   The most recent example is LUCENE-1521.  I'd like to improve the message in the exception to include whether or not the file exists, to help understand why users are sometimes hitting this exception.  My best theory at this point is something external is removing the file out from under the IndexWriter.
"
1,"PUT method blocks against older serversTo reproduce, attempt a PUT request against an appropriate servlet under TC3.2
(yes I know that needs an upgrade - sigh)

RFC 2616 says:
""Because of the presence of older implementations, the protocol allows ambiguous
situations in which a client may send ""Expect: 100- continue"" without receiving
either a 417 (Expectation Failed) status or a 100 (Continue) status. Therefore,
when a client sends this header field to an origin server (possibly via a proxy)
from which it has never seen a 100 (Continue) status, the client SHOULD NOT wait
for an indefinite period before sending the request body.""

This isn't how HttpClient behaves. After sending the headers,
PutMethod.writeRequestBody() returns false. HttpMethodBase then calls
readStatusCode(), which blocks waiting for a read (or I guess you could time out
the whole request). Right now this makes it impossible to use HttpClient to PUT
to older Http 1.1 implementations.

A suggested resolution: since the spec allows for clients to avoid waiting if
they know the 100 response will not arrive, why not simply provide a boolean
flag to allow the 'wait for 100' behaviour in PutMethod.writeResponseBody() to
be turned off, on a per-request basis? This solution puts the burden of knowing
""origin server[s]...from which it has never seen a 100 (Continue) status"" on the
user of HttpClient. Less than perfect as you can only find out that this has
happened by trial and error.

A more correct solution, is to maintain a list of servers that ignore the Expect
header in PutMethod, and override PutMethod.readStatusCode() to time out, send
the body, remember this server is buggy, and read the status code again."

0,"Wire log is incomplete if HttpParser detects an errorIf HttpParser detects an error in any of the headers, it throws a ProtocolException

Although the failing header is included in the Exception detail, the headers leading up to the failure are not logged, which makes it hard to debug (and is quite confusing, as the PE does not appear to be related to the data that has been received).

This is because the wire-logging is done in the caller (HttpMethodDirector) which only logs the header if the parse succeeds.

Perhaps the Wire logging should be done at the point where the HttpParser reads the line."
1,"TimeLimitingCollector's TimeExceededException contains useless relative docidWe found another bug with the RandomIndexWriter: When TimeLimitingCollector breaks collection after timeout, it records the last/next collected docid. It does this without rebasing, so the docid is useless. TestTimeLimitingCollector checks the docid, but correctly rebases it (as only this makes sense). Because the RandomIndexWriter uses different merge settings, the index is now sometimes not optimized and so the test fails (which is correct, as the docid is useless for non-optimized index).

1,"javax.jcr.RepositoryException when a JOIN SQL2 query is send via Davex and has resultssee the following thread for details:

assuming a data structure as follows:
/foo [nt:unstructured]
/foo/bar [nt:unstructured]
/foo/bar@lala = huii (lala is string property of bar)
/ding [nt:unstructured]
/ding@dong = ##barUUID### (dong is a property of type ""Reference"")

then the following code will throw an exception:

QueryManager qm = s.getWorkspace().getQueryManager();

1,"IW.optimize() can do too many merges at the very endThis was fixed on trunk in LUCENE-1044 but I'd like to separately
backport it to 2.3.

With ConcurrentMergeScheduler there is a bug, only when CFS is on,
whereby after the final merge of an optimize has finished and while
it's building its CFS, the merge policy may incorrectly ask for
another merge to collapse that segment into a compound file.  The net
effect is optimize can spend many extra iterations unecessarily
merging a single segment to collapse it to compound file.

I believe the case is rare (hard to hit), and maybe only if you have
multiple threads calling optimize at once (the TestThreadedOptimize
test can hit it), but it's a low-risk fix so I plan to commit to 2.3
shortly.

0,"cache revalidation of variants does not update original variant entryWhen the cache stories multiple variant entries due to Vary headers in responses, the cache correctly sends a conditional request containing the etags of any existing variants on a ""variant miss"" (incoming request does not match the request variants already cached). In addition, when it receives a 304 response, it correctly returns the indicated variant to the request that causes the variant miss. However, it does not update the pre-existing variant cache entry as recommended by RFC 2616.

For example:

request 1, User-Agent: agent1 results in a 200 OK with Etag: etag1 and Vary: User-Agent.
request 2, User-Agent: agent2 causes an If-None-Match to the origin; if it returns 304 Not Modified with Etag: etag1
request 3, User-Agent: agent1 results in a 200 OK but gets the (outdated) entry that resulted from request 1

in other words, the origin response from request 2 does not update the variant for ""agent1"".

This does not cause incorrect behavior (this is a SHOULD) but does miss out on some caching opportunities here.

0,"Check if a DAV-Request has a Label in the header, before checking if it's version-controlledWhen looking at our MySQL logs, I realized that jackrabbit on each DAV Request calls the VERSION table every time I get a new node (which is not cached yet), even if I only do a simple getNode. 
As a versioning table can get pretty large, this may have a performance impact.

I found out, that DavResourceFactoryImpl checks, if a node is versioned to decide, if we have to check for the Label header to later check out another version for the GET request. I re-ordered those checks now so that it first checks, if there's an http Label-header and only then checks, if the node is versioned. The check for a Label header should be much faster than checking a DB, if it's versioned (and scale much better, too)

      containing an Authorization field, it MUST NOT return the
      corresponding response as a reply to any other request, unless one
      of the following specific exceptions holds:

      1. If the response includes the ""s-maxage"" cache-control
         directive, the cache MAY use that response in replying to a
         subsequent request. But (if the specified maximum age has
         passed) a proxy cache MUST first revalidate it with the origin
         server, using the request-headers from the new request to allow
         the origin server to authenticate the new request. (This is the
         defined behavior for s-maxage.) If the response includes ""s-

      2. If the response includes the ""must-revalidate"" cache-control

         it MAY be returned in reply to any subsequent request.""

http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html#sec14.8

It isn't clear whether the CachingHttpClient is a shared cache or not (it depends on where it gets used), so the conservative compliant behavior is to assume we are a shared cache. The current implementation is caching responses regardless of whether the original requests had Authorization headers or not.

Patch and discussion forthcoming.

"
0,"Static index pruning by in-document term frequency (Carmel pruning)This module provides tools to produce a subset of input indexes by removing postings data for those terms where their in-document frequency is below a specified threshold. The net effect of this processing is a much smaller index that for common types of queries returns nearly identical top-N results as compared with the original index, but with increased performance. 

Optionally, stored values and term vectors can also be removed. This functionality is largely independent, so it can be used without term pruning (when term freq. threshold is set to 1).

As the threshold value increases, the total size of the index decreases, search performance increases, and recall decreases (i.e. search quality deteriorates). NOTE: especially phrase recall deteriorates significantly at higher threshold values. 

Primary purpose of this class is to produce small first-tier indexes that fit completely in RAM, and store these indexes using IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]). Usually the performance of this class will not be sufficient to use the resulting index view for on-the-fly pruning and searching. 

NOTE: If the input index is optimized (i.e. doesn't contain deletions) then the index produced via IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[]) will preserve internal document id-s so that they are in sync with the original index. This means that all other auxiliary information not necessary for first-tier processing, such as some stored fields, can also be removed, to be quickly retrieved on-demand from the original index using the same internal document id. 

Threshold values can be specified globally (for terms in all fields) using defaultThreshold parameter, and can be overriden using per-field or per-term values supplied in a thresholds map. Keys in this map are either field names, or terms in field:text format. The precedence of these values is the following: first a per-term threshold is used if present, then per-field threshold if present, and finally the default threshold.

A command-line tool (PruningTool) is provided for convenience. At this moment it doesn't support all functionality available through API."

0,"Supporting deleteDocuments in IndexWriter (Code and Performance Results Provided)Today, applications have to open/close an IndexWriter and open/close an
IndexReader directly or indirectly (via IndexModifier) in order to handle a
mix of inserts and deletes. This performs well when inserts and deletes
come in fairly large batches. However, the performance can degrade
dramatically when inserts and deletes are interleaved in small batches.
This is because the ramDirectory is flushed to disk whenever an IndexWriter
is closed, causing a lot of small segments to be created on disk, which
eventually need to be merged.

We would like to propose a small API change to eliminate this problem. We
are aware that this kind change has come up in discusions before. See
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/23049?search_string=indexwriter%20delete;#23049
. The difference this time is that we have implemented the change and
tested its performance, as described below.

API Changes
-----------
We propose adding a ""deleteDocuments(Term term)"" method to IndexWriter.
Using this method, inserts and deletes can be interleaved using the same
IndexWriter.

Note that, with this change it would be very easy to add another method to
IndexWriter for updating documents, allowing applications to avoid a
separate delete and insert to update a document.

Also note that this change can co-exist with the existing APIs for deleting
documents using an IndexReader. But if our proposal is accepted, we think
those APIs should probably be deprecated.

Coding Changes
--------------
Coding changes are localized to IndexWriter. Internally, the new
deleteDocuments() method works by buffering the terms to be deleted.
Deletes are deferred until the ramDirectory is flushed to disk, either
because it becomes full or because the IndexWriter is closed. Using Java
synchronization, care is taken to ensure that an interleaved sequence of
inserts and deletes for the same document are properly serialized.

We have attached a modified version of IndexWriter in Release 1.9.1 with
these changes. Only a few hundred lines of coding changes are needed. All
changes are commented by ""CHANGE"". We have also attached a modified version
of an example from Chapter 2.2 of Lucene in Action.

Performance Results
-------------------
To test the performance our proposed changes, we ran some experiments using
the TREC WT 10G dataset. The experiments were run on a dual 2.4 Ghz Intel
Xeon server running Linux. The disk storage was configured as RAID0 array
with 5 drives. Before indexes were built, the input documents were parsed
to remove the HTML from them (i.e., only the text was indexed). This was
done to minimize the impact of parsing on performance. A simple
WhitespaceAnalyzer was used during index build.

We experimented with three workloads:
  - Insert only. 1.6M documents were inserted and the final
    index size was 2.3GB.
  - Insert/delete (big batches). The same documents were
    inserted, but 25% were deleted. 1000 documents were
    deleted for every 4000 inserted.
  - Insert/delete (small batches). In this case, 5 documents
    were deleted for every 20 inserted.

                                current       current          new
Workload                      IndexWriter  IndexModifier   IndexWriter
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Insert only                     116 min       119 min        116 min
Insert/delete (big batches)       --          135 min        125 min
Insert/delete (small batches)     --          338 min        134 min

As the experiments show, with the proposed changes, the performance
improved by 60% when inserts and deletes were interleaved in small batches.

----

RandomizedRunner is a JUnit runner, so it is capable of running @Test-annotated test cases. It
respects regular lifecycle hooks such as @Before, @After, @BeforeClass or @AfterClass, but it
also adds the following:

Randomized, but repeatable execution and infrastructure for dealing with randomness:

- uses pseudo-randomness (so that a given run can be repeated if given the same starting seed)
  for many things called ""random"" below,
- randomly shuffles test methods to ensure they don't depend on each other,
- randomly shuffles hooks (within a given class) to ensure they don't depend on each other,
- base class RandomizedTest provides a number of methods for generating random numbers, strings
  and picking random objects from collections (again, this is fully repeatable given the
  initial seed if there are no race conditions),
- the runner provides infrastructure to augment stack traces with information about the initial
  seeds used for running the test, so that it can be repeated (or it can be determined that
  the test is not repeatable -- this indicates a problem with the test case itself).

Thread control:

- any threads created as part of a test case are assigned the same initial random seed 
  (repeatability),
- tracks and attempts to terminate any Threads that are created and not terminated inside 
  a test case (not cleaning up causes a test failure),
- tracks and attempts to terminate test cases that run for too long (default timeout: 60 seconds,
  adjustable using global property or annotations),

Improved validation and lifecycle support:

- RandomizedRunner uses relaxed contracts of hook methods' accessibility (hook methods _can_ be
  private). This helps in avoiding problems with method shadowing (static hooks) or overrides
  that require tedious super.() chaining). Private hooks are always executed and don't affect
  subclasses in any way, period.
- @Listeners annotation on a test class allows it to hook into the execution progress and listen
  to events.
- @Validators annotation allows a test class to provide custom validation strategies 
  (project-specific). For example a base class can request specific test case naming strategy
  (or reject JUnit3-like methods, for instance).
- RandomizedRunner does not ""chain"" or ""suppress"" exceptions happening during execution of 
  a test case (including hooks). All exceptions are reported as soon as they happened and multiple
  failure reports can occur. Most environments we know of then display these failures sequentially
  allowing a clearer understanding of what actually happened first.

0,"SessionImpl#isSupportedOption: Skip descriptor evaluation if descriptor has not been loadedfollowup issue for JCR-3076.

as jukka stated changing the jcr-server to serve the repository-descriptor without mandating a successful login would
require quite some changes on the server side as the current flow demands a successful repository login in order
to be access any resource including the root resource that acts as parent for all (available) workspaces. since the
repository-descriptor report has be requested one of the resources it also mandates a successful login although
retrieving descriptors on the jcr-level is possible when just having the repository at hand.

on the other hand i would assume that the descriptor functionality present on the Repository is rarely used.
therefore i would suggest to just relax the check for supported options in the jcr2spi session implementation
and skip the evaluation if the descriptor isn't available at all. consequently the failure of a non-supported
feature would be postponed to the point it reaches the SPI (instead of informing the API consumer upfront). 
on the other hand supported operations would not fail just because the descriptors have not been loaded."

0,"Improve architecture of FieldSortedHitQueuePer the discussion (quite some time ago) on issue LUCENE-806, I'd like to propose an architecture change to the way FieldSortedHitQueue works, and in particular the way it creates SortComparatorSources. I think (I hope) that anyone who looks at the FSHQ code will agree that the class does a lot and much of it's repetitive stuff that really has no business being in that class.

I am about to attach a patch which, in and of itself, doesn't really achieve much that's concrete but does tidy things up a great deal and makes it easier to plug in different behaviours. I then have a subsequent patch which provides a fairly simple and flexible example of how you might replace an implementation, in this case the field-local-String-comparator version from LUCENE-806.

The downside to this patch is that it involved changing the signature of SortComparatorSource.newComparator to take a Locale. There would be ways around this (letting FieldSortedHitQueue take in either a SortComparatorSource or some new, improved interface which takes a Locale (and possibly extends SortComparatorSource). I'm open to this but personally I think that the Locale version makes sense and would suggest that the code would be nicer by breaking the API (and hence targeting this to, presumably, 3.0 at a minimum).

This code does not include specific tests (I will add these, if people like the general idea I'm proposing here) but all current tests pass with this change.

Patch to follow."
1,"ExportSysViewTest fails with: System property org.xml.sax.driver not specifiedThe ExportSysViewTest class uses the XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader() method that depends on the system property ""org.xml.sax.driver"" being specified.

The current workaround is to explicitly force a Transformer to be loaded, but we really should fix the cause of this issue for example by replacing the XMLReader instance with a SAXParser."

When we then try to open the reader (for warming), which as of LUCENE-2311 will now [correctly] open the doc stores, we hit FNFE because the SegmentInfo for the merge does not realize that the doc stores were turned into  a cfx.

I would suggest a new issue for tracking, and a patch in which SpellChecker.clearIndex doesn't call unlock unless isLocked returns true.

1,"Problems with custom nodes in journalI have an application that uses custom node types and I am having problems in a clustered configuration.

Issue 1: the following definition in a nodetype is incorrectly read from the journal:
  + * (nt:hierarchyNode) version

The * is stored in the journal as _x002a_ since it should be a QName and it gets escaped.
When read, the code ...core.nodetype.compact.CompactNodeTypeDefReader.doChildNodeDefinition does the following test:

        if (currentTokenEquals('*')) {
            ndi.setName(ItemDef.ANY_NAME); 
        } else {
            ndi.setName(toQName(currentToken));
        }

Since currentToken is _x002a_ and not * toQName(currentToken) is called but it fails.
I changed the test to:
        if (currentTokenEquals('*') || currentTokenEquals(""_x002a_""))
            ....
and that fixes the problem.

Issue 2: when storing a nodeType in the journal the superclass nt:base is not store, but when reading I get an error saying the node should be a subclass of nt:base.

The code in...core.nodetype.compact.CompactNodeTypeDefWriter.writeSupertypes skips nt:base when writing the node.

When reading the nodetype definition from the journal the following exception is thrown:

Unable to deliver node type operation: [{http://namespace/app/repository/1.0}resource] all primary node types except nt:base itself must be (directly or indirectly) derived from nt:base

probably because nt:base is not re-added to the nodetype definition

It unexepctedly binds SortField to needing an IndexReader to do the
guessing.

It's caused various problems in the past (most recently, for me on
LUCENE-1656) as we fix other issues/make improvements.

I'd prefer that users of Lucene's field sort be explicit about the

optional strong[er] typing of Lucene's fields, such type information
would already be known.  But in the meantime, I think users should be

0,"[PATCH] MultiFieldQueryParser and BooleanQuery do not provide adequate support for queries across multiple fieldsThe attached test case demonstrates this problem and provides a fix:
  1.  Use a custom similarity to eliminate all tf and idf effects, just to 
isolate what is being tested.
  2.  Create two documents doc1 and doc2, each with two fields title and 
description.  doc1 has ""elephant"" in title and ""elephant"" in description.  
doc2 has ""elephant"" in title and ""albino"" in description.
  3.  Express query for ""albino elephant"" against both fields.
Problems:
      a.  MultiFieldQueryParser won't recognize either document as containing 
both terms, due to the way it expands the query across fields.
      b.  Expressing query as ""title:albino description:albino title:elephant 
description:elephant"" will score both documents equivalently, since each 
matches two query terms.
  4.  Comparison to MaxDisjunctionQuery and my method for expanding queries 
across fields.  Using notation that () represents a BooleanQuery and ( | ) 
represents a MaxDisjunctionQuery, ""albino elephant"" expands to:
        ( (title:albino | description:albino)
          (title:elephant | description:elephant) )
This will recognize that doc2 has both terms matched while doc1 only has 1 
term matched, score doc2 over doc1.

Refinement note:  the actual expansion for ""albino query"" that I use is:
        ( (title:albino | description:albino)~0.1
          (title:elephant | description:elephant)~0.1 )
This causes the score of each MaxDisjunctionQuery to be the score of highest 
scoring MDQ subclause plus 0.1 times the sum of the scores of the other MDQ 
subclauses.  Thus, doc1 gets some credit for also having ""elephant"" in the 
description but only 1/10 as much as doc2 gets for covering another query term 
in its description.  If doc3 has ""elephant"" in title and both ""albino"" 
and ""elephant"" in the description, then with the actual refined expansion, it 
gets the highest score of all (whereas with pure max, without the 0.1, it 
would get the same score as doc2).

In real apps, tf's and idf's also come into play of course, but can affect 
these either way (i.e., mitigate this fundamental problem or exacerbate it)."

http://blog.mikemccandless.com/2011/06/lucenes-near-real-time-search-is-fast.html).

A simple rate limiter improves the spikey NRT reopen times during big
merges, so I think we should somehow make this possible.  Likely this
would reduce impact on searches as well.

Typically apps that do indexing and searching on same box are in no
rush to see the merges complete so this is a good tradeoff.

0,"[RFE] Allow streaming of POST methods via chunked transfer encoding.This is an RFE with a possible implementation attached. The implementation does
not modify any existing code.

We're using HTTP POST to send a large amount of data with an unknown size. We
don't want to buffer the entire request, so we implemented a streaming POST
method. The implementation has 3 classes: StreamedPostMethod,
BufferedChunkedOutputStream and OutputStreamWriter. The bulk of the code is in
the BufferedChunkedOutputStream, which may be a good target for replacing
ChunkedOutputStream from the main distribution.

BufferedChunkedOutputStream has the following charactersitics:
1) It has an internal 2K buffer. Without the buffer, chunk sizes would be too
small in many cases (e.g. ObjectOutputStream likes to call write(byte[]) with 4
byte long arguments). 2K was chosen to minimize the chunk overhead to less than 1%.
2) If the entire entity body fits within the 2K buffer, it does not use
chunking. This implies that the headers are only sent out when the first chunk
(or the entire body) has to be written, but no sooner.
3) The chunk size is not limited to 2K: if write(byte[]) is called with a large
argument, the internal buffer and the new request are sent out as a single chunk.
4) Because of (2) it's tightly coupled to StreamedPostMethod.reallyWriteHeaders.
5) StreamedPostMethod calls BufferedChunkedOutputStream.finish() to write the
last buffer and ending chunk.

Because of 4 and 5, we didn't want to touch ChunkedOutputStream. Interestingly,
EntityEnclosingMethod is already tightly coupled to ChunkedOutputStream because
it has to call writeClosingChunk. There is probably some room for refactoring here.

The package is just a suggestion; feel free to move the files as appropirate.
This code was written against 2.0rc2. We're hoping it will get included in time
for the 2.1 release.

To use the code, you must implement OutputStreamWriter and pass it to
StreamedPostMethod's constructor. Execute the method as usual.

Caveats: StreamedPostMethod does not implement Expect/continue logic. We had no
way to test this. It is also strictly for POST. In general, the same methodology
is applicable to PUT, etc. It should be fairly simple to generalize.

When you have a very large index, to which you are adding batches of small updates, these calls to optimize make using addIndexes() impossible.  It makes parallel updates very frustrating.

Here is an optimized function that helps out by calling mergeSegments only on the newly added documents.  It will try to avoid calling mergeSegments until the end, unless you're adding a lot of documents at once.

I also have an extensive unit test that verifies that this function works correctly if people are interested.  I gave it a different name because it has very different performance characteristics which can make querying take longer."
1,"SpellChecker does not work properly on calling indexDictionary after clearIndexWe have to call clearIndex and indexDictionary to rebuild dictionary from fresh. The call to SpellChecker clearIndex() function does not reset the searcher. Hence, when we call indexDictionary after that, many entries that are already in the stale searcher will not be indexed.

Also, I see that IndexReader reader is used for the sole purpose of obtaining the docFreq of a given term in exist() function. This functionality can also be obtained by using just the searcher by calling searcher.docFreq. Thus, can we get away completely with reader and code associated with it like
      if (IndexReader.isLocked(spellIndex)){
	IndexReader.unlock(spellIndex);

0,"Add an explicit method to invoke IndexDeletionPolicyToday, if one uses an IDP which holds onto segments, such as SnapshotDeletionPolicy, or any other IDP in the tests, those segments are left in the index even if the IDP no longer references them, until IW.commit() is called (and actually does something). I'd like to add a specific method to IW which will invoke the IDP's logic and get rid of the unused segments w/o forcing the user to call IW.commit(). There are a couple of reasons for that:

* Segments take up sometimes valuable HD space, and the application may wish to reclaim that space immediately. In some scenarios, the index is updated once in several hours (or even days), and waiting until then may not be acceptable.
* I think it's a cleaner solution than waiting for the next commit() to happen. One can still wait for it if one wants, but otherwise it will give you the ability to immediately get rid of those segments.
* TestSnapshotDeletionPolicy includes this code, which only strengthens (IMO) the need for such method:
{code}
// Add one more document to force writer to commit a
// final segment, so deletion policy has a chance to
// delete again:
Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(new Field(""content"", ""aaa"", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.ANALYZED, Field.TermVector.WITH_POSITIONS_OFFSETS));
writer.addDocument(doc);
{code}

If IW had an explicit method, that code would not need to exist there at all ...

Here comes the fun part - naming the baby:
* invokeDeletionPolicy -- describes exactly what is going to happen. However, if the user did not set IDP at all (relying on default, which I think many do), users won't understand what is it.
* deleteUnusedSegments - more user-friendly, assuming users understand what 'segments' are.

BTW, IW already has deleteUnusedFiles() which only tries to delete unreferenced files that failed to delete before (such as on Windows, due to e.g. open readers). Perhaps instead of inventing a new name, we can change IW.deleteUnusedFiles to call IndexFileDeleter.checkpoint (instead of deletePendingFiles) which deletes those files + calls IDP.onCommit()."

* Add tests.iter.min (default to tests.iter) to denote that at least N instances of the test should run until there's either a failure or tests.iter is reached.

If one wants to run until the first failure, he can set tests.iter.min=1 and tests.iter=X -- up to X instances of the test will run, until the first failure.

Similarly, one can set tests.iter=N to denote that at least N instances should run, regardless if there were failures, but if after N runs a failure occurred, the test should stop.

Note: unlike what's proposed on the thread, tests.iter.max is dropped from this proposal as it's exactly like tests.iter, so no point in having two similar parameters.

And probably should be changed to something like:

1,"Calling size method of a ManageableArrayList causes NullPointerExceptionWhen using the NTCollectionConverterImpl with proxy=""true"" a call on the size () method of a ManageableArrayList causes a NullPointerException if there is no underlying List. LazyCollectionLoader doLoad returns null because there is are no children.

The ManageableArrayList is created because the isNull method of the NTCollectionConverterImpl class always returns false. 
According to the comment line this is done because the getCollectionNodes always returns a list. 
But after the fix for JCR-882 this is not correct anymore.

The attached fix corrects this. 

The only question remaining is how to differ between an empty list and a null-value for the field containing the list."

0,"[PATCH] Efficiently retrieve sizes of field valuesSometimes an application would like to know how large a document is before retrieving it.  This can be important for memory management or choosing between algorithms, especially in cases where documents might be very large.

This patch extends the existing FieldSelector mechanism with two new FieldSelectorResults:  SIZE and SIZE_AND_BREAK.  SIZE creates fields on the retrieved document that store field sizes instead of actual values.  SIZE_AND_BREAK is especially efficient if one field comprises the bulk of the document size (e.g., the body field) and can thus be used as a reasonable size approximation.

0,"CharArraySet cannot be made generic, because it violates the Set<char[]> interfaceI tried to make CharArraySet using generics (extends AbstractSet<char[]>) but this is not possible, as it e.g. returns sometimes String instances in the Iterator instead of [].

What to do? Make it Set<?> or just place a big @SuppressWarnings(""unchecked""> in front of it?

Because of this problem also a lot of Set declarations inside StopAnalyzer cannot be made generic as you never know whats inside."

1,"IndexWriter.synced  field accumulates data leading to a Memory LeakI am running into a strange OutOfMemoryError. My small test application does
index and delete some few files. This is repeated for 60k times. Optimization
is run from every 2k times a file is indexed. Index size is 50KB. I did analyze
the HeapDumpFile and realized that IndexWriter.synced field occupied more than
half of the heap. That field is a private HashSet without a getter. Its task is
to hold files which have been synced already.

There are two calls to addAll and one call to add on synced but no remove or
clear throughout the lifecycle of the IndexWriter instance.

According to the Eclipse Memory Analyzer synced contains 32618 entries which
look like file names ""_e065_1.del"" or ""_e067.cfs""

The index directory contains 10 files only.

I guess synced is holding obsolete data "

1,"Yet another race in IW#nrtIsCurrentIn IW#nrtIsCurrent looks like this:

{code}
  synchronized boolean nrtIsCurrent(SegmentInfos infos) {
    ensureOpen();
    return infos.version == segmentInfos.version && !docWriter.anyChanges() && !bufferedDeletesStream.any();
  }
{code}

* the version changes once we checkpoint the IW
* docWriter has changes if there are any docs in ram or any deletes in the delQueue
* bufferedDeletes contain all frozen del packages from the delQueue

yet, what happens is 1. we decrement the numDocsInRam in DWPT#doAfterFlush (which is executed during DWPT#flush) but before we checkpoint. 2. if we freeze deletes (empty the delQueue) we put them in the flushQueue to maintain the order.  This means they are not yet in the bufferedDeleteStream.

Bottom line, there is a window where we could see IW#nrtIsCurrent returning true if we check within this particular window. Phew, I am not 100% sure if that is the reason for our latest failure in SOLR-2861 but from what the logs look like this could be what happens. If we randomly hit low values for maxBufferedDocs & maxBufferedDeleteTerms this is absolutely possible."

0,"Add set/getLocalAddress methods to HostConfigurationOn clustered or multi-homed systems, there's a need to specify the local bind
address of sockets, to ensure that they're created on the right interface.  To
do this, the local address needs to be passed to the 4-argument version of
ProtcolSocketFactory.createSocket.

After discussion on the mailing list, the best approach for this seems to be
adding the local address as a property on HostConfiguration and HttpConnection.  

I've attached a patch which does the following:
- Add public set/getLocalAddress methods to HostConfiguration and HttpConnection.
- HttpConnection uses the local address when opening connections.
- Modify HostConfiguration.equals and hostEquals to compare the local address too.
- SimpleHttpConnectionManager uses the local address from the provided config. 
I also cleaned up its getConnection method a bit.
- HttpClient.executeMethod uses the local address from its default
HostConfiguration if the method's config doesn't specify one."

0,"Deprecate all String/File ctors/opens in IndexReader/IndexWriter/IndexSearcherDuring investigation of LUCENE-1658, I found out, that even LUCENE-1453 is not completely fixed.
As 1658 deprecates all FSDirectory.getDirectory() static factories, we should not use them anymore. As the user is now free to choose the correct directory implementation using direct instantiation or using FSDir.open() he should no longer use all ctors/methods in IndexWriter/IndexReader/IndexSearcher & Co. that simply take path names as String or File and always instantiate the Directory himself.

LUCENE-1453 currently works for the cached directory implementations from FSDir.getDirectory, but not with uncached, non refcounting FSDirs. Sometime reopen() closes the directory (as far as I see, when a SegmentReader changes to a MultiSegmentReader and/or deletes apply). This is hard to track. In Lucene 3.0 we then can remove the whole bunch of closeDirectory parameters/fields in these classes and simply do not care anymore about closing directories.

To remove this closeDirectory parameter now (before 3.0) and also fix 1453 correctly, an additional idea would be to change these factories that take the File/String to return the IndexReader wrapped by a FilteredIndexReader, that keeps track on closing the underlying directory after close and reopen. This is simplier than passing this boolean between different DirectoryIndexReader instances. The small performance impact by wrapping with FilterIndexReader should not be so bad, because the method is deprecated and we can state, that it is better to user the factory method with Directory parameter."

0,"add IndexWriter.removeUnferencedFiles, so apps can more immediately delete index files when readers are closedThis has come up several times on the user's list.

On Windows, which prevents deletion of still-open files, IndexWriter cannot remove files that are in-use by open IndexReaders.  This is fine, and IndexWriter periodically retries the delete, but it doesn't retry very often (only on open, on flushing a new segment, and on committing a merge).  So it lacks immediacy.

With this expert method, apps that want faster deletion can call this method."
