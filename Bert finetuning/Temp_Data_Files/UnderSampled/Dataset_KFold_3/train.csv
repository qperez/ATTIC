0,"Move SmartChineseAnalyzer & resources to own contrib projectSmartChineseAnalyzer depends on  a large dictionary that causes the analyzer jar to grow up to 3MB. The dictionary is quite big compared to all the other resouces / class files contained in that jar. 
Having a separate analyzer-cn contrib project enables footprint-sensitive users (e.g. using lucene on a mobile phone) to include analyzer.jar without getting into trouble with disk space.

Moving SmartChineseAnalyzer to a separate project could also include a small refactoring as Robert mentioned in [LUCENE-1722|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1722] several classes should be package protected, members and classes could be final, commented syserr and logging code should be removed etc.

0,"better handling of files inside/outside CFS by codecSince norms and deletes were moved under Codec (LUCENE-3606, LUCENE-3661),
we never really properly addressed the issue of how Codec.files() should work,
considering these files are always stored outside of CFS.

LUCENE-3606 added a hack, LUCENE-3661 cleaned up the hack a little bit more,
but its still a hack.

Currently the logic in SegmentInfo.files() is:
{code}
clearCache()

if (compoundFile) {
  // don't call Codec.files(), hardcoded CFS extensions, etc
} else {
  Codec.files()
}

// always add files stored outside CFS regardless of CFS setting
Codec.separateFiles()

if (sharedDocStores) {
  // hardcoded shared doc store extensions, etc
}
{code}

Also various codec methods take a Directory parameter, but its inconsistent
what this Directory is in the case of CFS: for some parts of the index its
the CFS directory, for others (deletes, separate norms) its not.

I wonder if instead we could restructure this so that SegmentInfo.files() logic is:
{code}
clearCache()
Codec.files()
{code}

and so that Codec is instead responsible.

instead Codec.files logic by default would do the if (compoundFile) thing, and
Lucene3x codec itself would only have the if (sharedDocStores) thing, and any
part of the codec that wants to put stuff always outside of CFS (e.g. Lucene3x separate norms, deletes) 
could just use SegmentInfo.dir. Directory parameters in the case of CFS would always
consistently be the CFSDirectory.

I haven't totally tested if this will work but there is definitely some cleanups 
we can do either way, and I think it would be a good step to try to clean this up
and simplify it.

Then suddenly we broke the index format because we are using Strings here without a reasonable comparator API.

0,"Provide access to port of Host headerWe use a load balancer that connects to the HTTP server and the HTTP server
connects to the application server. We use port translation in our load
balancer. So when e.g. a client connects to 90 of the load balancer, the load
balancer connects to port 100 of the HTTP server. The load balancer doesn't
change the Host request header, so in the host request header is still the
original virtual host name and port, in this case port 90. For this reason, the
virtual hosts of the HTTP server and application server are configured based on
the external port numbers, so in this case port 90.
 
For test purposes, we sometimes want to connect directly to the HTTP server or
the application server, bypassing the load balancer. To do this, we need to
connect to the same port as the load balancer would, in this example port 100,
but the host header of this request should be the same as if the request would
go through the load balancer, so in this example port 90, because the HTTP
server and application server's virtual hosts are configured for this port.

The attached patch adds the possibility to specify the port number for virtual
hosts.

Here's a code snippet that uses the patched code:

HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
HttpMethod method = new GetMethod();
HostConfiguration hostConfiguration = new HostConfiguration();
hostConfiguration.setHost(""localhost"", 80, ""http"");
HostParams params = new HostParams();
params.setVirtualHost(""localhost"");

I implemented (based on RangeFilter) another approach for faster
RangeQueries, based on longs stored in index in a special format.

The idea behind this is to store the longs in different precision in index
and partition the query range in such a way, that the outer boundaries are
search using terms from the highest precision, but the center of the search
Range with lower precision. The implementation stores the longs in 8
different precisions (using a class called TrieUtils). It also has support
for Doubles, using the IEEE 754 floating-point ""double format"" bit layout
with some bit mappings to make them binary sortable. The approach is used in
rather big indexes, query times are even on low performance desktop
computers <<100 ms (!) for very big ranges on indexes with 500000 docs.

I called this RangeQuery variant and format ""TrieRangeRange"" query because
the idea looks like the well-known Trie structures (but it is not identical
to real tries, but algorithms are related to it).

also i would like to introduce a new ""homepage"" with a little bit more attractive content like jackrabbit
news, maybe featured jackrabbit applications, schedules and events.

ideally i would like to re-organize the file structure according to the navigation, which may break
bookmarks and search indexes.

like you just wrangle up the deletes and kick them out of the party and

0,"Default lock timeouts should have static setter/getters
We recently stopped using Java system properties to derive defaults for things like the write/commit lock timeout, and switched to getter/setter's across all classes.  See here:

    http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/27447

But, in the case at least of the write lock timeout, because it's marked ""public final static"", a consumer of this API can no longer change this value before instantiating the IndexWriter.  This is because the getter/setter for this is not static, which generally makes sense so you can change the timeout for each instance of IndexWriter.  But because IndexWriter on construction uses the timeout value, some uses cases need to change the value before getting an instance of IndexWriter.

This was actually a regression, in that Lucene users lost functionality they previously had, on upgrading.

I would propose that that we add getter/setter for the default value of this timeout, which would be static.  I'll attach a patch file.

See this thread for context that led to this issue:

0,"revise max-per-host configurationMax-per-host settings for ThreadSafeClientConnManagers are currently stored in HttpParams, where the parameter value is a map from HttpRoute (formerly HostConfiguration) to Integer. This has several drawbacks:

1) maintaining a map as a value in HttpParams doesn't match my understanding of how params should be used
2) the maximums based on HttpRoute are really specific to the TSCCM implementation and not a generic parameterization

some of the options are:

a) revise to define a more generic parameterization approach
b) revise into an implementation specific parameterization approach
c) define an implementation (TSCCM) specific configuration interface and a default implementation keeping the map as run-time data

0,"Refactor DocumentsWriterI've been working on refactoring DocumentsWriter to make it more
modular, so that adding new indexing functionality (like column-stride
stored fields, LUCENE-1231) is just a matter of adding a plugin into
the indexing chain.

This is an initial step towards flexible indexing (but there is still
alot more to do!).

And it's very much still a work in progress -- there are intemittant
thread safety issues, I need to add tests cases and test/iterate on
performance, many ""nocommits"", etc.  This is a snapshot of my current
state...

The approach introduces ""consumers"" (abstract classes defining the
interface) at different levels during indexing.  EG DocConsumer
consumes the whole document.  DocFieldConsumer consumes separate
fields, one at a time.  InvertedDocConsumer consumes tokens produced
by running each field through the analyzer.  TermsHashConsumer writes
its own bytes into in-memory posting lists stored in byte slices,
indexed by term, etc.

DocumentsWriter*.java is then much simpler: it only interacts with a
DocConsumer and has no idea what that consumer is doing.  Under that
DocConsumer there is a whole ""indexing chain"" that does the real work:

  * NormsWriter holds norms in memory and then flushes them to _X.nrm.

  * FreqProxTermsWriter holds postings data in memory and then flushes
    to _X.frq/prx.

  * StoredFieldsWriter flushes immediately to _X.fdx/fdt

  * TermVectorsTermsWriter flushes immediately to _X.tvx/tvf/tvd

DocumentsWriter still manages things like flushing a segment, closing
doc stores, buffering & applying deletes, freeing memory, aborting
when necesary, etc.

In this first step, everything is package-private, and, the indexing
chain is hardwired (instantiated in DocumentsWriter) to the chain
currently matching Lucene trunk.  Over time we can open this up.

There are no changes to the index file format.

For the most part this is just a [large] refactoring, except for these
two small actual changes:

  * Improved concurrency with mixed large/small docs: previously the
    thread state would be tied up when docs finished indexing
    out-of-order.  Now, it's not: instead I use a separate class to
    hold any pending state to flush to the doc stores, and immediately
    free up the thread state to index other docs.

  * Buffered norms in memory now remain sparse, until flushed to the
    _X.nrm file.  Previously we would ""fill holes"" in norms in memory,
    as we go, which could easily use way too much memory.  Really this
    isn't a solution to the problem of sparse norms (LUCENE-830); it
    just delays that issue from causing memory blowup during indexing;
    memory use will still blowup during searching.

I expect performance (indexing throughput) will be worse with this
change.  I'll profile & iterate to minimize this, but I think we can
accept some loss.  I also plan to measure benefit of manually
re-cycling RawPostingList instances from our own pool, vs letting GC
recycle them.

0,"Hardening of NativeFSLockNativeFSLock create a test lock file which its name might collide w/ another JVM that is running. Very unlikely, but still it happened a couple of times already, since the tests were parallelized. This may result in a false exception thrown from release(), when the lock file's delete() is called and returns false, because the file does not exist (deleted by another JVM already). In addition, release() should give a second attempt to delete() if it fails, since the file may be held temporarily by another process (like AntiVirus) before it fails. The proposed changes are:

1) Use ManagementFactory.getRuntimeMXBean().getName() as part of the test lock name (should include the process Id)
2) In release(), if delete() fails, check if the file indeed exists. If it is, let's attempt a re-delete() few ms later.
3) If (3) still fails, throw an exception. Alternatively, we can attempt a deleteOnExit.

I'll post a patch later today."

0,"Change IndexSearcher multisegment searches to search each individual segment using a single HitCollectorThis issue changes how an IndexSearcher searches over multiple segments. The current method of searching multiple segments is to use a MultiSegmentReader and treat all of the segments as one. This causes filters and FieldCaches to be keyed to the MultiReader and makes reopen expensive. If only a few segments change, the FieldCache is still loaded for all of them.

This patch changes things by searching each individual segment one at a time, but sharing the HitCollector used across each segment. This allows FieldCaches and Filters to be keyed on individual SegmentReaders, making reopen much cheaper. FieldCache loading over multiple segments can be much faster as well - with the old method, all unique terms for every segment is enumerated against each segment - because of the likely logarithmic change in terms per segment, this can be very wasteful. Searching individual segments avoids this cost. The term/document statistics from the multireader are used to score results for each segment.

When sorting, its more difficult to use a single HitCollector for each sub searcher. Ordinals are not comparable across segments. To account for this, a new field sort enabled HitCollector is introduced that is able to collect and sort across segments (because of its ability to compare ordinals across segments). This TopFieldCollector class will collect the values/ordinals for a given segment, and upon moving to the next segment, translate any ordinals/values so that they can be compared against the values for the new segment. This is done lazily.

All and all, the switch seems to provide numerous performance benefits, in both sorted and non sorted search. We were seeing a good loss on indices with lots of segments (1000?) and certain queue sizes / queries, but the latest results seem to show thats been mostly taken care of (you shouldnt be using such a large queue on such a segmented index anyway).

* Introduces
** MultiReaderHitCollector - a HitCollector that can collect across multiple IndexReaders. Old HitCollectors are wrapped to support multiple IndexReaders.
** TopFieldCollector - a HitCollector that can compare values/ordinals across IndexReaders and sort on fields.
** FieldValueHitQueue - a Priority queue that is part of the TopFieldCollector implementation.
** FieldComparator - a new Comparator class that works across IndexReaders. Part of the TopFieldCollector implementation.
** FieldComparatorSource - new class to allow for custom Comparators.
* Alters
** IndexSearcher uses a single HitCollector to collect hits against each individual SegmentReader. All the other changes stem from this ;)
* Deprecates
** TopFieldDocCollector

0,"Tiered flushing of DWPTs by RAM with low/high water marksNow that we have DocumentsWriterPerThreads we need to track total consumed RAM across all DWPTs.

A flushing strategy idea that was discussed in LUCENE-2324 was to use a tiered approach:  
- Flush the first DWPT at a low water mark (e.g. at 90% of allowed RAM)
- Flush all DWPTs at a high water mark (e.g. at 110%)
- Use linear steps in between high and low watermark:  E.g. when 5 DWPTs are used, flush at 90%, 95%, 100%, 105% and 110%.

Should we allow the user to configure the low and high water mark values explicitly using total values (e.g. low water mark at 120MB, high water mark at 140MB)?  Or shall we keep for simplicity the single setRAMBufferSizeMB() config method and use something like 90% and 110% for the water marks?"
0,"Break the spi2dav dependency to jcr-serverCurrently the spi2dav component has a dependency on the jcr-server component, which is troublesome due to the extra transitive dependencies and which strictly speaking should not be necessary from an architectural point of view.

The dependency exists mostly for sharing a number of JCR-specific WebDAV constants. I'd like to push those constants down to jackrabbit-webdav as they are essentially just shared strings and as jackrabbit-webdav already contains a number of constants used by JCR extensions.

In addition to constant values, code in the following classes is shared between jcr-server and spi2dav: JcrValueType, NamespacesProperty, NodeTypesProperty, SearchResultProperty, SubscriptionImpl, ValuesProperty. The shared code in JcrValueType and SubscriptionImpl is mostly just about mapping constant value mappings and could fairly easily be moved to jackrabbit-webdav. The Property classes are a but trickier, but it looks like it would be possible to split the code to separate server- and client-side classes for jcr-server and spi2dav."

0,"refactoring of Similarity.sloppyFreq() and Similarity.scorePayloadCurrently these are top-level, but they only affect the SloppyDocScorer.
So it makes more sense to put these into the SloppyDocScorer api, this gives you additional flexibility

Furthermore, there are the following confusing existing issues:
* scorePayload should take bytesref
* PayloadTermScorer passes a *null* byte[] array to the sim if there are no payloads. I don't think it should do this, and its inconsistent with PayloadNearQuery, which does not do this. Its an undocumented conditional you need to have in the scoring algorithm which we should remove.
* there is an unused constant for scorepayload (NO_DOC_ID_PROVIDED), which is a documented, but never used anywhere. I think we should remove this conditional too, because its not possible to have a payload without a docid, and we shouldn't be passing fake document ids (-1) to our scoring APIs anyway.

the back-compat tag, commit changes to the tests to use the new
package private APIs on that branch, then fix nightly build to use the
tip of that branch?o]

There's still plenty to do before this is committable! This is a
rather large change:

  * Switches to a new more efficient terms dict format.  This still
    uses tii/tis files, but the tii only stores term & long offset
    (not a TermInfo).  At seek points, tis encodes term & freq/prox
    offsets absolutely instead of with deltas delta.  Also, tis/tii
    are structured by field, so we don't have to record field number
    in every term.
.
    On first 1 M docs of Wikipedia, tii file is 36% smaller (0.99 MB
    -> 0.64 MB) and tis file is 9% smaller (75.5 MB -> 68.5 MB).
.
    RAM usage when loading terms dict index is significantly less
    since we only load an array of offsets and an array of String (no
    more TermInfo array).  It should be faster to init too.
.
    This part is basically done.

  * Introduces modular reader codec that strongly decouples terms dict
    from docs/positions readers.  EG there is no more TermInfo used
    when reading the new format.
.
    There's nice symmetry now between reading & writing in the codec
    chain -- the current docs/prox format is captured in:
{code}
FormatPostingsTermsDictWriter/Reader
FormatPostingsDocsWriter/Reader (.frq file) and
FormatPostingsPositionsWriter/Reader (.prx file).
{code}
    This part is basically done.

  * Introduces a new ""flex"" API for iterating through the fields,
    terms, docs and positions:
{code}
FieldProducer -> TermsEnum -> DocsEnum -> PostingsEnum
{code}
    This replaces TermEnum/Docs/Positions.  SegmentReader emulates the
    old API on top of the new API to keep back-compat.
    
Next steps:

  * Plug in new codecs (pulsing, pfor) to exercise the modularity /
    fix any hidden assumptions.

  * Expose new API out of IndexReader, deprecate old API but emulate
    old API on top of new one, switch all core/contrib users to the
    new API.

  * Maybe switch to AttributeSources as the base class for TermsEnum,
    DocsEnum, PostingsEnum -- this would give readers API flexibility
    (not just index-file-format flexibility).  EG if someone wanted
    to store payload at the term-doc level instead of
    term-doc-position level, you could just add a new attribute.

  * Test performance & iterate.

It's got tons of nocommits, doesn't properly handle the user dict nor
extended modes yet, etc.

One thing I'm playing with is to add a double backtrace for the long
compound tokens, ie, instead of penalizing these tokens so that
shorter tokens are picked, leave the scores unchanged but on backtrace
take that penalty and use it as a threshold for a 2nd best
segmentation...

0,"Optimize the core tokenizers/analyzers & deprecate Token.termTextThere is some ""low hanging fruit"" for optimizing the core tokenizers
and analyzers:

  - Re-use a single Token instance during indexing instead of creating
    a new one for every term.  To do this, I added a new method ""Token
    next(Token result)"" (Doron's suggestion) which means TokenStream
    may use the ""Token result"" as the returned Token, but is not
    required to (ie, can still return an entirely different Token if
    that is more convenient).  I added default implementations for
    both next() methods in TokenStream.java so that a TokenStream can
    choose to implement only one of the next() methods.

  - Use ""char[] termBuffer"" in Token instead of the ""String
    termText"".

    Token now maintains a char[] termBuffer for holding the term's
    text.  Tokenizers & filters should retrieve this buffer and
    directly alter it to put the term text in or change the term
    text.

    I only deprecated the termText() method.  I still allow the ctors
    that pass in String termText, as well as setTermText(String), but
    added a NOTE about performance cost of using these methods.  I
    think it's OK to keep these as convenience methods?

    After the next release, when we can remove the deprecated API, we
    should clean up Token.java to no longer maintain ""either String or
    char[]"" (and the initTermBuffer() private method) and always use
    the char[] termBuffer instead.

  - Re-use TokenStream instances across Fields & Documents instead of
    creating a new one for each doc.  To do this I added an optional
    ""reusableTokenStream(...)"" to Analyzer which just defaults to
    calling tokenStream(...), and then I implemented this for the core
    analyzers.

I'm using the patch from LUCENE-967 for benchmarking just
tokenization.

The changes above give 21% speedup (742 seconds -> 585 seconds) for
LowerCaseTokenizer -> StopFilter -> PorterStemFilter chain, tokenizing
all of Wikipedia, on JDK 1.6 -server -Xmx1024M, Debian Linux, RAID 5
IO system (best of 2 runs).

If I pre-break Wikipedia docs into 100 token docs then it's 37% faster
(1236 sec -> 774 sec), I think because of re-using TokenStreams across
docs.

I'm just running with this alg and recording the elapsed time:

  analyzer=org.apache.lucene.analysis.LowercaseStopPorterAnalyzer
  doc.tokenize.log.step=50000
  docs.file=/lucene/wikifull.txt
  doc.maker=org.apache.lucene.benchmark.byTask.feeds.LineDocMaker
  doc.tokenized=true
  doc.maker.forever=false

  {ReadTokens > : *

See this thread for discussion leading up to this:

  http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/51283

I also fixed Token.toString() to work correctly when termBuffer is
used (and added unit test).

0,"Make IndexReader really read-only in Lucene 4.0As we change API completely in Lucene 4.0 we are also free to remove read-write access and commits from IndexReader. This code is so hairy and buggy (as investigated by Robert and Mike today) when you work on SegmentReader level but forget to flush in the DirectoryReader, so its better to really make IndexReaders readonly.

Currently with IndexReader you can do things like:
- delete/undelete Documents -> Can be done by with IndexWriter, too (using deleteByQuery)
- change norms -> this is a bad idea in general, but when we remove norms at all and replace by DocValues this is obsolete already. Changing DocValues should also be done using IndexWriter in trunk (once it is ready)"

0,"Invalid redirects are not correctedIf a get is made to a page with a query argument containing a space, many web
servers, notably including Tomcat 5 can generate a redirect in which the space
in the query argument is not escaped correctly.  Most browsers including IE and

location.  Http client does not.  When this broken URL is presented to a

0,"Cannot use Lucene in an unsigned applet due to Java security restrictionsA few of the Lucene source files call System.getProperty and perform a couple of
other operations within static initializers that assume full Java 2 permissions.
This prevents Lucene from being used from an unsigned applet embedded in a
browser page, since the default security permissions for an applet will prohibit
reading of most properties.

I would suggest wrapping the initialization of the properties in try/catch
blocks. This does mean that a couple properties would need to be made non-final,
and in some cases, getter and setter methods might be desirable to allow the
applet programmer to change the property values at runtime (some variables are
public static and could be changed directly without accessors).

This problem occurs with the shipping 1.4.3 version as well as the latest (as of
 07-apr-2005) source code fetched from CVS.

Currently, the files that are affected are org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter,
org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentReader, org.apache.lucene.search.BooleanQuery,
and org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectory.

I have modified versions of these files with some suggested changes, plus a
simple test applet and associated files that demonstrate the situation. The
sample applet can be launched in a browser either by double-clicking the file
locally or by putting it on a web server and launching it from an http URL. As
soon as I can figure out how to attach to a bug report, I'll do that.

0,"test granularity for calendar (date) propertiesThere are repositories out there that do support properties of type Date, but not Calendar (the main difference being that Calendar also captures the time zone). Also, some repositories may not be able to store timestamps with millisecond resolution.

Although both these restrictions make a repository non-compliant, it would be useful for the tests to test these aspects as separate issues. Thus I propose to simplify the existing tests so that they just compare timestamps (factoring out the time zone), and do not require resolution finer than 1s. These two aspects then should be tested in a separate test case (thinking of it, they currently may not test sub-second resolution, in which case I propose to leave things as they are with respect to this).

 "
0,"Replacement for TermAttribute+Impl with extended capabilities (byte[] support, CharSequence, Appendable)For flexible indexing terms can be simple byte[] arrays, while the current TermAttribute only supports char[]. This is fine for plain text, but e.g NumericTokenStream should directly work on the byte[] array.
Also TermAttribute lacks of some interfaces that would make it simplier for users to work with them: Appendable and CharSequence

I propose to create a new interface ""CharTermAttribute"" with a clean new API that concentrates on CharSequence and Appendable.
The implementation class will simply support the old and new interface working on the same term buffer. DEFAULT_ATTRIBUTE_FACTORY will take care of this. So if somebody adds a TermAttribute, he will get an implementation class that can be also used as CharTermAttribute. As both attributes create the same impl instance both calls to addAttribute are equal. So a TokenFilter that adds CharTermAttribute to the source will work with the same instance as the Tokenizer that requested the (deprecated) TermAttribute.

To also support byte[] only terms like Collation or NumericField needs, a separate getter-only interface will be added, that returns a reusable BytesRef, e.g. BytesRefGetterAttribute. The default implementation class will also support this interface. For backwards compatibility with old self-made-TermAttribute implementations, the indexer will check with hasAttribute(), if the BytesRef getter interface is there and if not will wrap a old-style TermAttribute (a deprecated wrapper class will be provided): new BytesRefGetterAttributeWrapper(TermAttribute), that is used by the indexer then."

0,"Allow servlet filters to specify custom session providersIn order to integrate the Jackrabbit davex server functionality with their custom authentication logic, the Sling project currently needs to embed and subclass the davex servlet classes. It would be cleaner if such tight coupling wasn't needed.

One way to achieve something like that would be to allow external components to provide a custom SessionProvider instance as an extra request attribute. This way for example a servlet filter that implements such custom authentication logic could easily make its functionality available to the standard davex servlet in Jackrabbit."
0,"AttributeSource/TokenStream API improvementsThis patch makes the following improvements to AttributeSource and
TokenStream/Filter:

- introduces interfaces for all Attributes. The corresponding
  implementations have the postfix 'Impl', e.g. TermAttribute and
  TermAttributeImpl. AttributeSource now has a factory for creating
  the Attribute instances; the default implementation looks for
  implementing classes with the postfix 'Impl'. Token now implements
  all 6 TokenAttribute interfaces.

- new method added to AttributeSource:
  addAttributeImpl(AttributeImpl). Using reflection it walks up in the
  class hierarchy of the passed in object and finds all interfaces
  that the class or superclasses implement and that extend the
  Attribute interface. It then adds the interface->instance mappings
  to the attribute map for each of the found interfaces.

- removes the set/getUseNewAPI() methods (including the standard
  ones). Instead it is now enough to only implement the new API,
  if one old TokenStream implements still the old API (next()/next(Token)),
  it is wrapped automatically. The delegation path is determined via
  reflection (the patch determines, which of the three methods was
  overridden).

- Token is no longer deprecated, instead it implements all 6 standard
  token interfaces (see above). The wrapper for next() and next(Token)
  uses this, to automatically map all attribute interfaces to one
  TokenWrapper instance (implementing all 6 interfaces), that contains
  a Token instance. next() and next(Token) exchange the inner Token
  instance as needed. For the new incrementToken(), only one
  TokenWrapper instance is visible, delegating to the currect reusable
  Token. This API also preserves custom Token subclasses, that maybe
  created by very special token streams (see example in Backwards-Test).

- AttributeImpl now has a default implementation of toString that uses
  reflection to print out the values of the attributes in a default
  formatting. This makes it a bit easier to implement AttributeImpl,
  because toString() was declared abstract before.

- Cloning is now done much more efficiently in
  captureState. The method figures out which unique AttributeImpl
  instances are contained as values in the attributes map, because
  those are the ones that need to be cloned. It creates a single
  linked list that supports deep cloning (in the inner class
  AttributeSource.State). AttributeSource keeps track of when this
  state changes, i.e. whenever new attributes are added to the
  AttributeSource. Only in that case will captureState recompute the
  state, otherwise it will simply clone the precomputed state and
  return the clone. restoreState(AttributeSource.State) walks the
  linked list and uses the copyTo() method of AttributeImpl to copy
  all values over into the attribute that the source stream
  (e.g. SinkTokenizer) uses. 

- Tee- and SinkTokenizer were deprecated, because they use
Token instances for caching. This is not compatible to the new API
using AttributeSource.State objects. You can still use the old
deprecated ones, but new features provided by new Attribute types
may get lost in the chain. A replacement is a new TeeSinkTokenFilter,
which has a factory to create new Sink instances, that have compatible
attributes. Sink instances created by one Tee can also be added to
another Tee, as long as the attribute implementations are compatible
(it is not possible to add a sink from a tee using one Token instance
to a tee using the six separate attribute impls). In this case UOE is thrown.

The cloning performance can be greatly improved if not multiple
AttributeImpl instances are used in one TokenStream. A user can
e.g. simply add a Token instance to the stream instead of the individual
attributes. Or the user could implement a subclass of AttributeImpl that
implements exactly the Attribute interfaces needed. I think this
should be considered an expert API (addAttributeImpl), as this manual
optimization is only needed if cloning performance is crucial. I ran
some quick performance tests using Tee/Sink tokenizers (which do
cloning) and the performance was roughly 20% faster with the new
API. I'll run some more performance tests and post more numbers then.

Note also that when we add serialization to the Attributes, e.g. for
supporting storing serialized TokenStreams in the index, then the
serialization should benefit even significantly more from the new API
than cloning. 

This issue contains one backwards-compatibility break:
TokenStreams/Filters/Tokenizers should normally be final
(see LUCENE-1753 for the explaination). Some of these core classes are 
not final and so one could override the next() or next(Token) methods.
In this case, the backwards-wrapper would automatically use
incrementToken(), because it is implemented, so the overridden
method is never called. To prevent users from errors not visible
during compilation or testing (the streams just behave wrong),
this patch makes all implementation methods final
(next(), next(Token), incrementToken()), whenever the class
itsself is not final. This is a BW break, but users will clearly see,
that they have done something unsupoorted and should better
create a custom TokenFilter with their additional implementation
(instead of extending a core implementation).

For further changing contrib token streams the following procedere should be used:

    *  rewrite and replace next(Token)/next() implementations by new API
    * if the class is final, no next(Token)/next() methods needed (must be removed!!!)
    * if the class is non-final add the following methods to the class:
{code:java}
      /** @deprecated Will be removed in Lucene 3.0. This method is final, as it should
       * not be overridden. Delegates to the backwards compatibility layer. */
      public final Token next(final Token reusableToken) throws java.io.IOException {
        return super.next(reusableToken);
      }

      /** @deprecated Will be removed in Lucene 3.0. This method is final, as it should
       * not be overridden. Delegates to the backwards compatibility layer. */
      public final Token next() throws java.io.IOException {
        return super.next();
      }
{code}
Also the incrementToken() method must be final in this case
(and the new method end() of LUCENE-1448)

0,"Optimize BlockTermsReader.seekWhen we seek, we first consult the terms index to find the right block
of 32 (default) terms that may hold the target term.  Then, we scan
that block looking for an exact match.

The scanning just uses next() and then compares the full term, but
this is actually rather wasteful.  First off, since all terms in the
block share a common prefix, we should compare the target against that
common prefix once, and then only compare the new suffix of each
term.  Second, since the term suffixes have already been read up front
into a byte[], we should do a no-copy comparison (vs today, where we
first read a copy into the local BytesRef and then compare).

With this opto, I removed the ability for BlockTermsWriter/Reader to
support arbitrary term sort order -- it's now hardwired to
BytesRef.utf8SortedAsUnicode.

0,"IndexWriter.mergeSegments should not hold the commit lock while cleaning up.Same happens in IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[] readers).

The commit lock should be obtained whenever the Index structure/version is read or written.  It should be kept for as short a period as possible.

The write lock is needed to make sure only one IndexWriter or IndexReader instance can update the index (multiple IndexReaders can of course use the index for searching).

The list of files that can be deleted is stored in the file ""deletable"".  It is only read or written by the IndexWriter instance that holds the write lock, so there's no need to have the commit lock to to update it.

On my production system deleting the obsolete segment files after a mergeSegments() happens can occasionally take several seconds(!) and the commit lock blocks the searcher machines from updating their IndexReader instance.
Even on a standalone machine, the time to update the segments file is about 3ms, the time to delete the obsolete segments about 30ms.
"
0,"DateParser refactoring; Stateful cookie specsPresently DateParser is tightly coupled with the DefaultHttpParams class. I find
this sub-optimal from the design standpoint. Moreover, I believe that date
patterns should be specifiable at the method, host, and client levels, not only
global one. Currently this is not the case, and out of sync with the rest of the
preference framework, which can result in quite a bit of confusion.

When refactoring the DateParser class I also realized that the cookie specs were
shared by all the HttpMethod instances and as such had to be stateless. Even
though it is presently the case, technically there's nothing that prevents the
user from implementing a stateful cookie spec, plugging it into HttpClient, and
by doing so potentially causing quite unpleasant concurrency issues. Therefore,
I believe pluggable cookie specs MAY NOT be shared. There should be a cookie
spec instance created per method invocation

This is because the zombie path of 'child' is equal to the new path after the move.

0,"FST should allow controlling how hard builder tries to share suffixesToday we have a boolean option to the FST builder telling it whether
it should share suffixes.

If you turn this off, building is much faster, uses much less RAM, and
the resulting FST is a prefix trie.  But, the FST is larger than it
needs to be.  When it's on, the builder maintains a node hash holding
every node seen so far in the FST -- this uses up RAM and slows things
down.

On a dataset that Elmer (see java-user thread ""Autocompletion on large
index"" on Jul 6 2011) provided (thank you!), which is 1.32 M titles
avg 67.3 chars per title, building with suffix sharing on took 22.5
seconds, required 1.25 GB heap, and produced 91.6 MB FST.  With suffix
sharing off, it was 8.2 seconds, 450 MB heap and 129 MB FST.

I think we should allow this boolean to be shade-of-gray instead:
usually, how well suffixes can share is a function of how far they are
from the end of the string, so, by adding a tunable N to only share
when suffix length < N, we can let caller make reasonable tradeoffs.

However, I had no idea which test caused that (i.e. opened the temp directory and did not release resources).

I think we should do the following:
* Track in LTC a map from dirName -> StackTraceElement
* In afterClass if _TestUtil.rmDir fails, print the STE of that particular dir, so we know where was this directory created from
* Make tempDirs private and create accessor method, so that we control the inserts to this map (today the Set is updated by LTC, _TestUtils and TestBackwards !)"

if we re-enable this code (and I think we should, at least in certain

0,"IOUtils.closeSafely should log suppressed Exceptions in stack trace of original Exception (a new feature of Java 7)I was always against Java 6 support, as it brings no really helpful new features into Lucene. But there are several things that make life easier in coming Java 7 (hopefully on July 28th, 2011). One of those is simplier Exception handling and suppression on Closeable, called ""Try-With-Resources"" (see http://docs.google.com/View?id=ddv8ts74_3fs7483dp, by the way all Lucene classes support these semantics in Java 7 automatically, the cool try-code below would work e.g. for IndexWriter, TokenStreams,...).

We already have this functionality in Lucene since adding the IOUtils.closeSafely() utility (which can be removed when Java 7 is the minimum requirement of Lucene - maybe in 10 years):

{code:java}
try (Closeable a = new ...; Closeable b = new ...) {
  ... use Closeables ...
} catch (Exception e) {
  dosomething;
  throw e;
}
{code}

This code will close a and b in an autogenerated finally block and supress any exception. This is identical to our IOUtils.closeSafely:

{code:java}
Exception priorException = null;
Closeable a,b;
try (Closeable a = new ...; Closeable b = new ...) {
  a = new ...;
  b = new ...
  ... use Closeables ...
} catch (Exception e) {
  priorException = e;
  dosomething;
} finally {
  IOUtils.closeSafely(priorException, a, b);
}
{code}

So this means we have the same functionality without Java 7, but there is one thing that makes logging/debugging much nicer:
The above Java 7 code also adds maybe suppressed Exceptions in those Closeables to the priorException, so when you print the stacktrace, it not only shows the stacktrace of the original Exception, it also prints all Exceptions that were suppressed to throw this Exception (all Closeable.close() failures):

For this in Java 7 a new method was added to Throwable, that allows logging such suppressed Exceptions (it is called automatically by the synthetic bytecode emitted by javac). This patch simply adds this functionality conditionally to IOUtils, so it ""registers"" all suppressed Exceptions, if running on Java 7. This is done by reflection: once it looks for this method in Throwable.class and if found, it invokes it in closeSafely, so the exceptions thrown on Closeable.close() don't get lost.

This makes debugging much easier and logs all problems that may occur.

This patch does *not* change functionality or behaviour, it just adds more nformation to the stack trace in a Java-7-way (similar to the way how Java 1.4 added causes). It works here locally on Java 6 and Java 7, but only Java 7 gets the additional stack traces. For Java 6 nothing changes. Same for Java 5 (if we backport to 3.x).

This would be our first Java 7 improvement (a minor one). Next would be NIO2... - but thats not easy to do with reflection only, so we have to wait 10 years :-)"

I tried delaying the buffer allocation in BufferedIndexInput by 
using this clone() method: 
 
  public Object clone() { 
    BufferedIndexInput clone = (BufferedIndexInput)super.clone(); 
    clone.buffer = null; 
    clone.bufferLength = 0; 
    clone.bufferPosition = 0; 
    clone.bufferStart = getFilePointer();  
    return clone; 
  } 
 
With this all term document iterators seem to be empty, no 
query in the test cases gives any results, for example TestDemo 
and TestBoolean2. 
As far as I can see, this delaying should work, but it doesn't and 
I have no idea why.

0,"Default KuromojiAnalyzer to use search modeKuromoji supports an option to segment text in a way more suitable for search,
by preventing long compound nouns as indexing terms.

In general 'how you segment' can be important depending on the application 
(see http://nlp.stanford.edu/pubs/acl-wmt08-cws.pdf for some studies on this in chinese)

The current algorithm punishes the cost based on some parameters (SEARCH_MODE_PENALTY, SEARCH_MODE_LENGTH, etc)
for long runs of kanji.

Some questions (these can be separate future issues if any useful ideas come out):
* should these parameters continue to be static-final, or configurable?
* should POS also play a role in the algorithm (can/should we refine exactly what we decompound)?
* is the Tokenizer the best place to do this, or should we do it in a tokenfilter? or both?
  with a tokenfilter, one idea would be to also preserve the original indexing term, overlapping it: e.g. ABCD -> AB, CD, ABCD(posInc=0)
  from my understanding this tends to help with noun compounds in other languages, because IDF of the original term boosts 'exact' compound matches.
  but does a tokenfilter provide the segmenter enough 'context' to do this properly?

Either way, I think as a start we should turn on what we have by default: its likely a very easy win.

0,"Two-stage state expansion for the FST: distance-from-root and child-count criteria.In the current implementation FST states are expanded into a binary search on labels (from a vector of transitions) when the child count of a state exceeds a given predefined threshold (NUM_ARCS_FIXED_ARRAY). This threshold affects automaton size and traversal speed (as it turns out when benchmarked). For some degenerate (?) data sets, close-to-the-root nodes could have a small number of children (below the threshold) and yet be traversed on every single seek.

A fix of this is to introduce two control thresholds: 
  EXPAND state if (distance-from-root <= MIN_DISTANCE || children-count >= NUM_ARCS_FIXED_ARRAY)

My plan is to create a data set that will prove this first and then to implement the workaround above."

0,"Integrate IndexReader with IndexWriter The current problem is an IndexReader and IndexWriter cannot be open
at the same time and perform updates as they both require a write
lock to the index. While methods such as IW.deleteDocuments enables
deleting from IW, methods such as IR.deleteDocument(int doc) and
norms updating are not available from IW. This limits the
capabilities of performing updates to the index dynamically or in
realtime without closing the IW and opening an IR, deleting or
updating norms, flushing, then opening the IW again, a process which
can be detrimental to realtime updates. 

This patch will expose an IndexWriter.getReader method that returns
the currently flushed state of the index as a class that implements
IndexReader. The new IR implementation will differ from existing IR
implementations such as MultiSegmentReader in that flushing will
synchronize updates with IW in part by sharing the write lock. All
methods of IR will be usable including reopen and clone.

0,"ConstantScoreQuery should directly support wrapping Query and simply strip off scoresEspecially in MultiTermQuery rewrite modes we often simply need to strip off scores from Queries and make them constant score. Currently the code to do this looks quite ugly: new ConstantScoreQuery(new QueryWrapperFilter(query))

As the name says, QueryWrapperFilter should make any other Query constant score, so why does it not take a Query as ctor param? This question was aldso asked quite often by my customers and is simply correct, if you think about it.

Looking closer into the code, it is clear that this would also speed up MTQs:
- One additional wrapping and method calls can be removed
- Maybe we can even deprecate QueryWrapperFilter in 3.1 now (it's now only used in tests and the use-case for this class is not really available) and LUCENE-2831 does not need the stupid hack to make Simon's assertions pass
- CSQ now supports out-of-order scoring and topLevel scoring, so a CSQ on top-level now directly feeds the Collector. For that a small trick is used: The score(Collector) calls are directly delegated and the scores are stripped by wrapping the setScorer() method in Collector

During that I found a visibility bug in Scorer (LUCENE-2839): The method ""boolean score(Collector collector, int max, int firstDocID)"" should be public not protected, as its not solely intended to be overridden by subclasses and is called from other classes, too! This leads to no compiler bugs as the other classes that calls it is mainly BooleanScorer(2) and thats in same package, but visibility is wrong. I will open an issue for that and fix it at least in trunk where we have no backwards-requirement."

Separately the whole INPUT_TYPE is very confusing... really all it's doing is ""declaring"" the allowed range of the characters of the input alphabet, and then the only thing that uses that is the write/readLabel methods (well and some confusing sugar methods in Builder!).

I think it'd be good if we take that into consideration even when optimizing. This will allow the caller to specify two constraints: maxNumSegments and maxMergeMB. Obviously both may not be satisfied, and therefore we will guarantee that if there is any segment above the threshold, the threshold constraint takes precedence and therefore you may end up w/ <maxNumSegments (if it's not 1) after optimize. Otherwise, maxNumSegments is taken into consideration.

As part of this change, I plan to change some methods to protected (from private) and members as well. I realized that if one wishes to implement his own LMP extension, he needs to either put it under o.a.l.index or copy some code over to his impl.

It's ""test-compile-contrib"" (if you will) that fails and rather being contrib-crawled, that's only done as the target of ""test"" in each contrib directory, at which point, it's running in the protected contrib-crawl.

Easy enough to lift this loop into another target, e.g., build-contrib-test. And that will start surfacing errors, which I can work through.

0,"Change all FilteredTermsEnum impls into TermsEnum decoratorsCurrently, FilteredTermsEnum has two ctors:
* FilteredTermsEnum(IndexReader reader, String field)
* FilteredTermsEnum(TermsEnum tenum)

But most of our concrete implementations (e.g. TermsRangeEnum) use the IndexReader+field ctor

In my opinion we should remove this ctor, and switch over all FilteredTermsEnum implementations to just take a TermsEnum.

Advantages:
* This simplifies FilteredTermsEnum and its subclasses, where they are more decorator-like (perhaps in the future we could compose them)
* Removes silly checks such as if (tenum == null) in every next()
* Allows for consumers to pass in enumerators however they want: e.g. its their responsibility if they want to use MultiFields or not, it shouldnt be buried in FilteredTermsEnum.

0,"[PATCH] cleaner API for Field.TextCurrently there are four methods named Field.Text(). As those methods have 
the same name and a very similar method signature, everyone will think these 
are just convenience methods that do the same thing. But they behave 
differently: the one that takes a Reader doesn't store the data, the one that 
takes a String does. I know that this is documented, but it's still not a nice 
API. Methods that behave differently should have diffent names. The attached 
patch deprecates two of the old methods and adds two new ones named 
Field.StoredText(). I think this is much easier to understand from the 
programmer's point-of-view and will help avoid bugs."
0,"improve test coverage for Multi*It seems like an easy win that when the test calls newSearcher(),

"
0,"Disable SearchManagerIn previous versions (e.g. SVN tag 0.1-spec0.14) it was possible to disable the SearchManagers by not configuring a search index path. In the current revision, a NullPointerException is thrown, if the search index configuration is missing, tough the rest of the system would support missing search index configuration as before.

I suggest to extend search index configuration interpretation in WorkspaceCfg.init as follows:

        Element srchConfig = wspElem.getChild(SEARCH_INDEX_ELEMENT);
        if (srchConfig != null) {
            String pathAttr = srchConfig.getAttributeValue(PATH_ATTRIB);
            if (pathAttr != null && pathAttr.length() > 0) {
                searchIndexDir = replaceVars(pathAttr, vars);
            }
        }

This only reads search index configuration if available.

The reason to switch of the SearchManager is, that in my use case enabling the SearchManager yields a performance degradation of a factor of 10 ! Instead of taking around 500ms (which is still too long :-) to save 3 nodes and 15 properties, it would take around 5 seconds to save the same amount of data. And I do not need the SearchManager in my use case."
0,"[PATCH] Enable application-level management of IndexWriter.ramDirectory sizeIndexWriter currently only supports bounding of in the in-memory index cache using maxBufferedDocs, which limits it to a fixed number of documents.  When document sizes vary substantially, especially when documents cannot be truncated, this leads either to inefficiencies from a too-small value or OutOfMemoryErrors from a too large value.

This simple patch exposes IndexWriter.flushRamSegments(), and provides access to size information about IndexWriter.ramDirectory so that an application can manage this based on total number of bytes consumed by the in-memory cache, thereby allow a larger number of smaller documents or a smaller number of larger documents.  This can lead to much better performance while elimianting the possibility of OutOfMemoryErrors.

The actual job of managing to a size constraint, or any other constraint, is left up the applicatation.

The addition of synchronized to flushRamSegments() is only for safety of an external call.  It has no significant effect on internal calls since they all come from a sychronized caller.

0,"Move SimpleWebdavServlet to jcr-server and make it abstractIn line with isse JCR-417, I suggest to partially move the SimpleWebdavServlet from the jcr-webapp project to the jcr-server project. By partially I mean, that the new (moved) servlet will be abstract and the getRepository() method will be abstract. The jcr-webapp project will still contain a SimpleWebdavServlet (for backwards compatibility maintaing the same name) which just extends the new servlet and implements the getRepository() method using the RepositoryAccess servlet.

This allows for the reuse of the jcr-server project including the abstract SimpleWebdavServlet in other environments. My intention is to include this project (along with the webdav) project in Sling.

Will provide a patch for this proposal

0,"Contrib: another highlighter approachMark Harwoods highlighter package is a great contribution to Lucene, I've used it a lot! However, when you have *large* documents (fields), highlighting can be quite time consuming if you increase the number of bytes to analyze with setMaxDocBytesToAnalyze(int). The default value of 50k is often too low for indexed PDFs etcetera, which results in empty highlight strings.

This is an alternative approach using term position vectors only to build fragment info objects. Then a StringReader can read the relevant fragments and skip() between them. This is a lot faster. Also, this method uses the *entire* field for finding the best fragments so you're always guaranteed to get a highlight snippet.

Because this method only works with fields which have term positions stored one can check if this method works for a particular field using following code (taken from TokenSources.java):

        TermFreqVector tfv = (TermFreqVector) reader.getTermFreqVector(docId, field);
        if (tfv != null && tfv instanceof TermPositionVector)
        {
          // use FulltextHighlighter
        }
        else
        {
          // use standard Highlighter
        }

Someone else might find this useful so I'm posting the code here."
0,"TopTermsScoringBooleanQueryRewrite minscorewhen using the TopTermsScoringBooleanQueryRewrite (LUCENE-2123), it would be nice if MultiTermQuery could set an attribute specifying the minimum required score once the Priority Queue is filled. 

This way, FilteredTermsEnums could adjust their behavior accordingly based on the minimal score needed to actually be a useful term (i.e. not just pass thru the pq)

An example is FuzzyTermsEnum: at some point the bottom of the priority queue contains words with edit distance of 1 and enumerating any further terms is simply a waste of time.
This is because terms are compared by score, then termtext. So in this case FuzzyTermsEnum could simply seek to the exact match, then end.

This behavior could be also generalized for all n, for a different impl of fuzzyquery where it is only looking in the term dictionary for words within edit distance of n' which is the lowest scoring term in the pq (they adjust their behavior during enumeration of the terms depending upon this attribute).

Other FilteredTermsEnums could make use of this minimal score in their own way, to drive the most efficient behavior so that they do not waste time enumerating useless terms.

0,"SQL2 joins on empty sets are not efficientIt seems that in the cases where the LEFT side of the join doesn't contain any hits, the QueryEngine in unable to generate an efficient query for the RIGHT side, so it basically select all the possible nodes.

Example:
LEFT side has hits, RIGHT side select is fast given some conditions: 
> SQL2 JOIN LEFT SIDE took 18 ms. fetched 145 rows.
> SQL2 JOIN RIGHT SIDE took 67 ms. fetched 0 rows.

LEFT side has no hits, RIGHT select everything
> SQL2 JOIN LEFT SIDE took 8 ms. fetched 0 rows.
> SQL2 JOIN RIGHT SIDE took 845 ms. fetched 13055 rows.
...so it fetches 130k nodes and doesn't keep any of them.

0,"improved compound file handlingCurrently CompoundFileReader could use some improvements, i see the following problems
* its CSIndexInput extends bufferedindexinput, which is stupid for directories like mmap.
* it seeks on every readInternal
* its not possible for a directory to override or improve the handling of compound files.

for example: it seems if you were impl'ing this thing from scratch, you would just wrap the II directly (not extend BufferedIndexInput,
and add compound file offset X to seek() calls, and override length(). But of course, then you couldnt throw read past EOF always when you should,
as a user could read into the next file and be left unaware.

however, some directories could handle this better. for example MMapDirectory could return an indexinput that simply mmaps the 'slice' of the CFS file.
its underlying bytebuffer etc naturally does bounds checks already etc, so it wouldnt need to be buffered, not even needing to add any offsets to seek(),
as its position would just work.

So I think we should try to refactor this so that a Directory can customize how compound files are handled, the simplest 
case for the least code change would be to add this to Directory.java:

{code}
  public Directory openCompoundInput(String filename) {
    return new CompoundFileReader(this, filename);
  }
{code}

Because most code depends upon the fact compound files are implemented as a Directory and transparent. at least then a subclass could override...
but the 'recursion' is a little ugly... we could still label it expert+internal+experimental or whatever.

0,"left nav of docs/index.html in dist artifacts links to hudson for javadocsWhen building the zip or tgz release artifacts, the docs/index.html file contained in that release (the starter point for people to read documentation) links ""API Docs"" to

this relates to the initial migration to hudson for the nightly builds and a plan to copy the javadocs back to lucene.apache.org that wasn't considered urgent since it was just for transient nightly docs, but a side affect is that the release documentation also links to hudson.

"
0,"terms index should not store useless suffixesThis idea came up when discussing w/ Robert how to improve our terms index...

The terms dict index today simply grabs whatever term was at a 0 mod 128 index (by default).

But this is wasteful because you often don't need the suffix of the term at that point.

EG if the 127th term is aa and the 128th (indexed) term is abcd123456789, instead of storing that full term you only need to store ab.  The suffix is useless, and uses up RAM since we load the terms index into RAM.

The patch is very simple.  The optimization is particularly easy because terms are now byte[] and we sort in binary order.

I tested on first 10M 1KB Wikipedia docs, and this reduces the terms index (tii) file from 3.9 MB -> 3.3 MB = 16% smaller (using StandardAnalyzer, indexing body field tokenized but title / date fields untokenized).  I expect on noisier terms dicts, especially ones w/ bad terms accidentally indexed, that the savings will be even more.

In the future we could do crazier things.  EG there's no real reason why the indexed terms must be regular (every N terms), so, we could instead pick terms more carefully, say ""approximately"" every N, but favor terms that have a smaller net prefix.  We can also index more sparsely in regions where the net docFreq is lowish, since we can afford somewhat higher seek+scan time to these terms since enuming their docs will be much faster."

0,"Optimization for FieldDocSortedHitQueueWhen updating core for generics,  I found the following as a optimization of FieldDocSortedHitQueue:

All FieldDoc values are Compareables (also the score or docid, if they
appear as SortField in a MultiSearcher or ParallelMultiSearcher). The code
of lessThan seems very ineffective, as it has a big switch statement on the
SortField type, then casts the value to the underlying numeric type Object,
calls Number.xxxValue() & co for it and then compares manually. As
j.l.Number is itself Comparable, I see no reason to do this. Just call
compareTo on the Comparable interface and we are happy. The big deal is that
it prevents casting and the two method calls xxxValue(), as Number.compareTo
works more efficient internally.

The only special cases are String sort, where the Locale may be used and the
score sorting which is backwards. But these are two if statements instead of
the whole switch.

I had not tested it now for performance, but in my opinion it should be
faster for MultiSearchers. All tests still pass (because they should).

0,"InstantiatedIndex - faster but memory consuming indexRepresented as a coupled graph of class instances, this all-in-memory index store implementation delivers search results up to a 100 times faster than the file-centric RAMDirectory at the cost of greater RAM consumption.

Performance seems to be a little bit better than log2n (binary search). No real data on that, just my eyes.

Populated with a single document InstantiatedIndex is almost, but not quite, as fast as MemoryIndex.

0,"contrib/benchmark - few improvements and a bug fixBenchmark byTask was slightly improved:

If a task sequence contained only simple tasks it worked as expected (i.e. child tasks did not report times/memory) but if a child was a task sequence, then its children would report - they should not - this was fixed, so this property is now ""penetrating/inherited"" all the way down.

2. doc size control now possible also for the Reuters doc maker. (allowing to index N docs of size C characters each.)

3. TrecDocMaker was added - it reads as input the .gz files used in Trec - e.g. .gov data - this can be handy to benchmark Lucene on these large collections.  Similar to the Reuters collection, the doc-maker scans the input directory for all the files and extracts documents from the files.  Here there are multiple documents in each input file. Unlike the Reuters collection, we cannot provide a 'loader' for these collections - they are available from http://trec.nist.gov - for research purposes.

The Strings are constructed using a Base 8000h encoding of the original binary data - each char of an encoded String represents a 15-bit chunk from the byte sequence.  Base 8000h was chosen because it allows for all lower 15 bits of char to be used without restriction; the surrogate range [U+D800-U+DFFF] does not represent valid chars, and would require complicated handling to avoid them and allow use of char's high bit.

I believe nearly any time a token > 100 characters in length is
produced, it's a bug in the analysis that the user is not aware of.

These long tokens cause all sorts of problems, downstream, so it's
best to catch them early at the source.

We can accomplish this by tacking on a LengthFilter onto the chains
for StandardAnalyzer, SimpleAnalyzer, WhitespaceAnalyzer, etc.

Should we do this in 2.3?  I realize this is technically a break in
backwards compatibility, however, I think it must be incredibly rare

This behaviour should be limited to only default credential logins (Session.login() with null Credentials) and it should be possible to disable it with a configuration option. We could even have this behaviour disabled by default, but enabled in the configuration file used with the JCR-348 automatic configuration.

This is a case against the ""secure by default"" design principle, but I think that in this case the benefits in easier setup outweight the security drawbacks, especially if coupled with the above restrictions and a clear documentation note about the insecure default.

FSDirectory returns a 0 length while RAMDirectory throws FNFE.

The problem is that the semantics of fileLength() are not defined. As proposed in the thread, we'll define the following semantics:

* Returns the length of the file denoted by <code>name</code> if the file exists. The return value may be anything between 0 and Long.MAX_VALUE.
* Throws FileNotFoundException if the file does not exist. Note that you can call dir.fileExists(name) if you are not sure whether the file exists or not.

For backwards we'll create a new method w/ clear semantics. Something like:

{code}
/**
 * @deprecated the method will become abstract when #fileLength(name) has been removed.
 */
public long getFileLength(String name) throws IOException {
  long len = fileLength(name);
  if (len == 0 && !fileExists(name)) {

  }

Subject: isHttp11 and HTTP/1.0 servers 


The boolean variable http11 is set on a method by method basis. For PutMethod, 
decisions (eg. Expect: 100-continue request header) are made prior to 
determining the value for Http11 (chicken and egg problem) and so the default 
(true) is used to produce the request. An HTTP/1.0 server hangs waiting for 
the extra data on the PUT method body. 

For applications that are using HttpClient (ie. they do not manipulate the 
HTTP methods directly and cannot be expected to set the value of Http11 for 
each method instance), shouldn't http11 have HttpClient scope ? This would 
allow an interaction (eg. OPTIONS) to set http11 and all methods thereafter 
would use this setting?

The problem is that two different hashCodes with the same lower bits will keep picking the same slots (the upper bits will be ignored).
This is because multiplication (*1347) only really shifts bits to the left... so given that the two codes already matched on the right, they will both pick the same increment, and this will keep them on the same path through the table (even though it's being added to numbers that differ on the left).  To resolve this, some bits need to be moved to the right when calculating the increment.

* its now unmaintained, so bugs have to either be hacked around, tests disabled, warnings placed, but some things simply cannot be fixed... we cannot actually ""support"" something that is no longer maintained: we do find JRE bugs (http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/SunJavaBugs) and its important that bugs actually get fixed: cannot do everything with hacks.
* because of its limitations, we do things like allow 20% slower grouping speed. I find it hard to believe we are sacrificing performance for this.

So, in summary: because we don't test it at all, because its buggy and unmaintained, and because we are sacrificing performance, I think we need to cutover the build system for the next release to require java 6.

0,"[PATCH] HTMLParser doesn't parse hexadecimal character referencesI recently inherited a project from an ex-colleague; it uses Lucene and in
particular the HTML Parser.  I've found that she had made an amendment to the

we depend on, but had not reported a bug.  If she had, someone might have
pointed out that her correction was wrong ...

0,"Proxy authentication does not handle multiple multiple authentication schemesMy proxy server returns the following header lines in the response:

    Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM

i.e., it returns two Proxy-Authenticate header lines. Unfortunately this does 
not work. In line 253 of class Authenticator (method: authenticate(HttpMethod, 
HttpState, Header, String)) I see this comment:

    // FIXME: Note that this won't work if there is more than one realm within 
the challenge

so it looks like this is something that isn't yet implemented. In the log, I 
can see that the Authenticator attempts to parse the realm, but it looks like
this is not being done correctly:

It looks wrong to me that the realm name seems to be parsed as:

to use Basic authentication in this case.

0,"equals and hashCode implementation in org.apache.lucene.search.* packageI would like to talk about the implementation of equals and hashCode method  in org.apache.lucene.search.* package. 

Example One:

org.apache.lucene.search.spans.SpanTermQuery (Super Class)
	<- org.apache.lucene.search.payloads.BoostingTermQuery (Sub Class)

Observation:

* BoostingTermQuery defines equals but inherits hashCode from SpanTermQuery. Definition of equals is a code clone of SpanTermQuery with a change in class name. 

Intention:

I believe the intention of equals redefinition in BoostingTermQuery is not to make the objects of SpanTermQuery and BoostingTermQuery comparable. ie. spanTermQuery.equals(boostingTermQuery) == false && boostingTermQuery.equals(spanTermQuery) == false.


Problem:

With current implementation, the intention might not be respected as a result of symmetric property violation of equals contract i.e.
spanTermQuery.equals(boostingTermQuery) == true (can be) && boostingTermQuery.equals(spanTermQuery) == false. (always)
(Note: Provided their state variables are equal)

Solution:

Change implementation of equals in SpanTermQuery from:

{code:title=SpanTermQuery.java|borderStyle=solid}
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!(o instanceof SpanTermQuery))
      return false;
    SpanTermQuery other = (SpanTermQuery)o;
    return (this.getBoost() == other.getBoost())
      && this.term.equals(other.term);
  }
{code}

To:
{code:title=SpanTermQuery.java|borderStyle=solid}
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
  	if(o == this) return true;
  	if(o == null || o.getClass() != this.getClass()) return false;
//    if (!(o instanceof SpanTermQuery))
//      return false;
    SpanTermQuery other = (SpanTermQuery)o;
    return (this.getBoost() == other.getBoost())
      && this.term.equals(other.term);
  }
{code}

Advantage:

* BoostingTermQuery.equals and BoostingTermQuery.hashCode is not needed while still preserving the same intention as before.
 
* Any further subclassing that does not add new state variables in the extended classes of SpanTermQuery, does not have to redefine equals and hashCode. 

* Even if a new state variable is added in a subclass, the symmetric property of equals contract will still be respected irrespective of implementation (i.e. instanceof / getClass) of equals and hashCode in the subclasses.


Example Two:


org.apache.lucene.search.CachingWrapperFilter (Super Class)
	<- org.apache.lucene.search.CachingWrapperFilterHelper (Sub Class)

Observation:
Same as Example One.

Problem:
Same as Example one.

Solution:
Change equals in CachingWrapperFilter from:
{code:title=CachingWrapperFilter.java|borderStyle=solid}
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (!(o instanceof CachingWrapperFilter)) return false;
    return this.filter.equals(((CachingWrapperFilter)o).filter);
  }
{code}

To:
{code:title=CachingWrapperFilter.java|borderStyle=solid}
  public boolean equals(Object o) {
//    if (!(o instanceof CachingWrapperFilter)) return false;
    if(o == this) return true;
    if(o == null || o.getClass() != this.getClass()) return false;
    return this.filter.equals(((CachingWrapperFilter)o).filter);
  }
{code}

Advantage:
Same as Example One. Here, CachingWrapperFilterHelper.equals and CachingWrapperFilterHelper.hashCode is not needed.


Example Three:

org.apache.lucene.search.MultiTermQuery (Abstract Parent)
	<- org.apache.lucene.search.FuzzyQuery (Concrete Sub)
	<- org.apache.lucene.search.WildcardQuery (Concrete Sub)

Observation (Not a problem):

* WildcardQuery defines equals but inherits hashCode from MultiTermQuery.
Definition of equals contains just super.equals invocation. 

* FuzzyQuery has few state variables added that are referenced in its equals and hashCode.
Intention:

I believe the intention here is not to make objects of FuzzyQuery and WildcardQuery comparable. ie. fuzzyQuery.equals(wildCardQuery) == false && wildCardQuery.equals(fuzzyQuery) == false.

Proposed Implementation:
How about changing the implementation of equals in MultiTermQuery from:

{code:title=MultiTermQuery.java|borderStyle=solid}
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
      if (this == o) return true;
      if (!(o instanceof MultiTermQuery)) return false;

      final MultiTermQuery multiTermQuery = (MultiTermQuery) o;

      if (!term.equals(multiTermQuery.term)) return false;

      return getBoost() == multiTermQuery.getBoost();
    }
{code}

To:
{code:title=MultiTermQuery.java|borderStyle=solid}
    public boolean equals(Object o) {
      if (this == o) return true;
//      if (!(o instanceof MultiTermQuery)) return false;
      if(o == null || o.getClass() != this.getClass()) return false;

      final MultiTermQuery multiTermQuery = (MultiTermQuery) o;

      if (!term.equals(multiTermQuery.term)) return false;

      return getBoost() == multiTermQuery.getBoost();
    }
{code}

Advantage:

Same as above. Here, WildcardQuery.equals is not needed as it does not define any new state. (FuzzyQuery.equals is still needed because FuzzyQuery defines new state.)

0,"Move text extraction into a background threadEven though text extraction is not done right on save() most of the extraction work is later done by a client thread. There is a mechanism in place that commits the deferred work in a background thread. But the background thread is only triggered by a timer and does not constantly write back pending index changes. For regular index changes this is done on purpose and should not be changed. However text extraction work should be moved completely into a background thread because it often takes a fair amount of time to index a large document.

Outline of a possible solution:
- all text filtering is tasks are put into a work queue
- the work queue is processed by a background thread
- basic indexing of nt:resource without text filtering takes place
- the background thread updates the index when text filtering completed for a nt:resource

There should be a configuration parameter that allows to execute text filtering without the background thread. This way it is possible to get the existing behaviour of Jackrabbit: the fulltext index is always up-to-date and can be used.
With the background process this is no longer the case."
0,"A tokenfilter to decompose compound wordsA tokenfilter to decompose compound words you find in many germanic languages (like German, Swedish, ...) into single tokens.

    when an exception occurs.

  * Added getMergeThread() method so you can override how the threads
    are created (eg, if you want to make them in a different thread
    group, use a pool, change priorities, etc.).

  * Added doMerge(...) to actually do this merge, so you can do

Once on disk the files are copied into the CFS format which is basically a unnecessary for some of the files. We can at any time write at least one file directly into the CFS which can save a reasonable amount of IO. For instance stored fields could be written directly during indexing and during a Codec Flush one of the written files can be appended directly. This optimization is a nice sideeffect for lucene indexing itself but more important for DocValues and LUCENE-3216 we could transparently pack per field files into a single file only for docvalues without changing any code once LUCENE-3216 is resolved.

0,"Setting SSLSocket parametersIn HttpClient 4.0.3, it was easy to subclass SSLSocketFactory, and set SSLSocket options (e.g. setEnabledCipherSuites() or setSSLParameterse()) before the SSL handshake happened. This way it was possible to e.g. restrict cipher suites on per-HttpClient basis (instead of JVM-wide system properties).

In HttpClient 4.1.1, the design has changed quite a lot, and copy-pasting of several long methods is needed. 

Ideally, SSLSocketFactory should support applying SSLParameters to the socket. However, SSLParameters is Java 1.6, so if we want to keep compatibility with 1.5, that's out.

However, it'd be nice to at least have a method (e.g. ""protected SSLSocket prepareSSLSocket(SSLSocket s)"") that would get called immediately after a socket is retrieved from the socket factory. The default implementation could be just ""return s;"", but subclasses could do something like s.setEnabledCipherSuites() s.setSSLParameters()."

The only troublesome part of the rename is the GenericRepositoryFactory.URI constant that was for a while documented on our wiki as a part of the canonical code snippet for accessing a remote repository based on the repository URI. The latest recommendation is to use the JcrUtils.getRepository(String uri) method so the constant is no longer needed in client code, but for backwards compatibility with earlier Jackrabbit 2.0 betas it may be good to keep the deprecated constant for at least the next beta release."
0,"Support easy pre-authenticated loginSome applications authenticate users themselves and just need to access the repository on behalf of these pre-authenticated users.

Examples of such pre-authentications include SSO solutions or web applications using a web-based authentication protocol not easily implementable in a JAAS LoginModule, for example OpenID or similar.

In such situations a password may not be provided in SimpleCredentials and thus regular login with user name and password is not possible.

Therefore I propose the enhancement of the AbstractLoginModule to allow for setting a specific attribute in the SimpleCredentials attribute map. If this attribute is set, authentication and login succeeds and a session for the user named in the SimpleCredentials is created.

As a starter we might just check for the presence of the attribute."

0,"IndexWriter has hard limit on max concurrencyDocumentsWriter has this nasty hardwired constant:

{code}
private final static int MAX_THREAD_STATE = 5;
{code}

which probably I should have attached a //nocommit to the moment I
wrote it ;)

That constant sets the max number of thread states to 5.  This means,
if more than 5 threads enter IndexWriter at once, they will ""share""
only 5 thread states, meaning we gate CPU concurrency to 5 running
threads inside IW (each thread must first wait for the last thread to
finish using the thread state before grabbing it).

This is bad because modern hardware can make use of more than 5
threads.  So I think an immediate fix is to make this settable
(expert), and increase the default (8?).

It's tricky, though, because the more thread states, the less RAM
efficiency you have, meaning the worse indexing throughput.  So you
shouldn't up and set this to 50: you'll be flushing too often.

But... I think a better fix is to re-think how threads write state
into DocumentsWriter.  Today, a single docID stream is assigned across
threads (eg one thread gets docID=0, next one docID=1, etc.), and each
thread writes to a private RAM buffer (living in the thread state),
and then on flush we do a merge sort.  The merge sort is inefficient
(does not currently use a PQ)... and, wasteful because we must
re-decode every posting byte.

I think we could change this, so that threads write to private RAM
buffers, with a private docID stream, but then instead of merging on
flush, we directly flush each thread as its own segment (and, allocate
private docIDs to each thread).  We can then leave merging to CMS
which can already run merges in the BG without blocking ongoing
indexing (unlike the merge we do in flush, today).

This would also allow us to separately flush thread states.  Ie, we
need not flush all thread states at once -- we can flush one when it
gets too big, and then let the others keep running.  This should be a
good concurrency gain since is uses IO & CPU resources ""throughout""
indexing instead of ""big burst of CPU only"" then ""big burst of IO
only"" that we have today (flush today ""stops the world"").

One downside I can think of is... docIDs would now be ""less
monotonic"", meaning if N threads are indexing, you'll roughly get
in-time-order assignment of docIDs.  But with this change, all of one
thread state would get 0..N docIDs, the next thread state'd get
N+1...M docIDs, etc.  However, a single thread would still get
monotonic assignment of docIDs.

0,"Add tool to upgrade all segments of an index to last recent supported index format without optimizingCurrently if you want to upgrade an old index to the format of your current Lucene version, you have to optimize your index or use addIndexes(IndexReader...) [see LUCENE-2893] to copy to a new directory. The optimize() approach fails if your index is already optimized.

I propose to add a custom MergePolicy to upgrade all segments to the last format. This MergePolicy could simply also ignore all segments already up-to-date. All segments in prior formats would be merged to a new segment using another MergePolicy's optimize strategy.

This issue is different from LUCENE-2893, as it would only support upgrading indexes from previous Lucene versions in-place using the official path. Its a tool for the end user, not a developer tool.

This addition should also go to Lucene 3.x, as we need to make users with pre-3.0 indexes go the step through 3.x, else they would not be able to open their index with 4.0. With this tool in 3.x the users could safely upgrade their index without relying on optimize to work on already-optimized indexes."

0,"Pass ClientConnectionManager to DefaultHttpClient constructorCopied from my mailing list post, Oleg suggested I post it to JIRA for 4.1 fix.

I'm trying to find the least verbose way of configuring a DefaultHttpClient with a ThreadSafeClientConnManager.

The example code given for this goes through a manual process of configuring HttpParams and SchemeRegistry objects, which is more or less copied from the DefaultHttpClient.createHttpParams() and createClientConnectionManager() methods.

It's a bit of a chicken and egg situation - DefaultHttpClient can create its own HttpParams and SchemeRegistry, which are themselves fine, but only once its been constructed, and the constructor requires the ThreadSafeClientConnManager, but that in turn requires the HttpParams and SchemeRegistry objects.  The only way out is to manually construct the HttpParams and SchemeRegistry, which is a waste.

It seems to me that DefaultHttpClient's constructor should take a ClientConnectionManagerFactory instead of a ClientConnectionManager. That way, the createClientConnectionManager() method already has the factory reference, and doesn't have to grub around in the HttpParams object to find it.

The code would then become:

new DefaultHttpClient(new ThreadSafeClientConnManagerFactory(), null);

where ThreadSafeClientConnManagerFactory.newInstance() just constructs ThreadSafeClientConnManager.  There's no manual construction of HttpParams and SchemeRegistry, you just leave it up to DefaultHttpClient.

- most obvious generics usage (there are tons of usages of sets, ... Those which are commonly used have been generified)
- PriorityQueue generification
- replacement of indexed for loops with for each constructs
- removal of unnececessary unboxing

The code is to my opinion much more readable with those features (you actually *know* what is stored in collections reading the code, without the need to lookup for field definitions everytime) and it simplifies many algorithms.

Note that this patch also includes an interface for the Query class. This has been done for my company's needs for building custom Query classes which add some behaviour to the base Lucene queries.

I am about to patch our copy to simply remove these four lines; the caller knows what the query string was (they have to have a copy of it because they are passing it in!) so having it in the error message itself is not useful.

Basically, there are situations where it would be useful to sort by freq first, instead of the current ""sort by edit distance, and then subsort by freq if edit distance is equal""

The author of the thread suggested ""What I think would work even better than allowing a custom compareTo function would be to incorporate the frequency directly into the distance function.  This would allow for greater control over the trade-off between frequency and edit distance""

However, custom compareTo functions are not always be possible (ie if a certain version of Lucene must be used, because it was release with Solr) and incorporating freq directly into the distance function may be overkill (ie depending on the implementation)

it is suggested that we have a simple modification of the existing compareTo function in Lucene to allow users to specify if they want the existing sort method or if they want to sort by freq.

however, it made the code look messy... I propose some new methods:
instead of some crazy code in your test like:

you use:
{code}
int numdocs = atLeast(100);

this will apply the multiplier, also factor in nightly, and finally add some random fudge... so e.g. in local runs its sometimes 127 docs, sometimes 113 docs, etc.

additionally instead of code like:
{code}
if ((TEST_NIGHTLY && random.nextBoolean()) || (random.nextInt(20) == 17)) {

you do

As 1658 deprecates all FSDirectory.getDirectory() static factories, we should not use them anymore. As the user is now free to choose the correct directory implementation using direct instantiation or using FSDir.open() he should no longer use all ctors/methods in IndexWriter/IndexReader/IndexSearcher & Co. that simply take path names as String or File and always instantiate the Directory himself.

LUCENE-1453 currently works for the cached directory implementations from FSDir.getDirectory, but not with uncached, non refcounting FSDirs. Sometime reopen() closes the directory (as far as I see, when a SegmentReader changes to a MultiSegmentReader and/or deletes apply). This is hard to track. In Lucene 3.0 we then can remove the whole bunch of closeDirectory parameters/fields in these classes and simply do not care anymore about closing directories.

To remove this closeDirectory parameter now (before 3.0) and also fix 1453 correctly, an additional idea would be to change these factories that take the File/String to return the IndexReader wrapped by a FilteredIndexReader, that keeps track on closing the underlying directory after close and reopen. This is simplier than passing this boolean between different DirectoryIndexReader instances. The small performance impact by wrapping with FilterIndexReader should not be so bad, because the method is deprecated and we can state, that it is better to user the factory method with Directory parameter."

First, the created node might already be mix:referenceable, either because its primary node type is a subtype of mix:referenceable or because the implementation added mix:referenceable as a mixin type in creating the node.  Second, a repository may restrict the nodes to which mix:referenceable can be added.

0,"DbDataStore: delete temporary files using finalize()Currently, reading from the DbDataStore creates a temporary file by default. If the application doesn't fully read or close the input stream, the file is not deleted. The best solution is to use finally { in.close() } in the application, but this is easily forgotten.

I suggest to delete the temp file using finalize(). There is a small performance penalty when creating the temporary object, but compared to I/O it is very small. Note that FileInputStream and FileOutputStream also use finalize()."

Currently jackrabbit-jcr-commons depends on both commons-collections and slf4j-api, but both dependencies are relatively isolated and could be dropped with relatively little effort.

That index is committed to disc when a certain amount of nodes (config param: minMergeDocs) has been added. Most of the times the volatile index will contain some nodes, causing a redo.log that needs to be applied when the jackrabbit process is killed.

In addition to the size threshold (minMergeDocs) of the volatile index, an idle time limit should force a commit to disc. The volatile index would be written to disc after some configurable idle time. This will result in an persistent index (on dic) which is most of the time in sync with the data, but still minimizes the disc IO during heavy modification activity on the workspace."
0,"Deprecation of autoCommit in 2.4 leads to compile problems, when autoCommit should be falseI am currently changing my code to be most compatible with 2.4. I switched on deprecation warnings and got a warning about the autoCommit parameter in IndexWriter constructors.

My code *should* use autoCommit=false, so I want to use the new semantics. The default of IndexWriter is still autoCommit=true. My problem now: How to disable autoCommit whithout deprecation warnings?

Maybe, the ""old"" constructors, that are deprecated should use autoCommit=true. But there are new constructors with this ""IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength mfl"" in it, that appear new in 2.4 but are deprecated:

IndexWriter(Directory d, boolean autoCommit, Analyzer a, boolean create, IndexDeletionPolicy deletionPolicy, IndexWriter.MaxFieldLength mfl) 
          Deprecated. This will be removed in 3.0, when autoCommit will be hardwired to false. Use IndexWriter(Directory,Analyzer,boolean,IndexDeletionPolicy,MaxFieldLength) instead, and call commit() when needed.

What the hell is meant by this, a new constructor that is deprecated? And the hint is wrong. If I use the other constructor in the warning, I get autoCommit=true.

There is something completely wrong.

It should be clear, which constructors set autoCommit=true, which set it per default to false (perhaps new ones), and the Deprecated text is wrong, if autoCommit does not default to false."

0,"Stored-only fields automatically enable norms and tf when added to documentDuring updating my internal components to the new TrieAPI, I have seen the following:

I index a lot of numeric fields with trie encoding omitting norms and term frequency. This works great. Luke shows that both is omitted.

As I sometimes also want to have the components of the field stored and want to use the same field name for it. So I add additionally the field again to the document, but stored only (as the Field c'tor using a TokenStream cannot additionally store the field). As it is stored only, I thought, that I can left out explicit setting of omitNorms and omitTermFreqAndPositions. After adding the stored-only-without-omits field, Luke shows all fields with norms enabled. I am not sure, if the norms/tf were really added to the index, but Luke shows a value for the norms and FieldInfo has it enabled.

In my opinion, this is not intuitive, o.a.l.document.Field  should switch both omit* options on when storing fields only (and also disable other indexing-only options). Alternatively the internal FieldInfo.update(boolean isIndexed, boolean storeTermVector, boolean storePositionWithTermVector, boolean storeOffsetWithTermVector, boolean omitNorms, boolean storePayloads, boolean omitTermFreqAndPositions) should only change the omit* and other options, if the isIndexed parameter (not this.isIndexed) is also true, elsewhere leave it as it is.

In principle, when adding a stored-only field, any indexing-specific options should not be changed in FieldInfo. If the field was indexed with norms before, norms should stay enabled (but this would be the default as it is)."

* Keep tests.iter as it is today
* Add tests.iter.min (default to tests.iter) to denote that at least N instances of the test should run until there's either a failure or tests.iter is reached.

If one wants to run until the first failure, he can set tests.iter.min=1 and tests.iter=X -- up to X instances of the test will run, until the first failure.

Similarly, one can set tests.iter=N to denote that at least N instances should run, regardless if there were failures, but if after N runs a failure occurred, the test should stop.

Note: unlike what's proposed on the thread, tests.iter.max is dropped from this proposal as it's exactly like tests.iter, so no point in having two similar parameters.

0,"Change defaults in IndexWriter to maximize ""out of the box"" performanceThis is follow-through from LUCENE-845, LUCENE-847 and LUCENE-870;
I'll commit this once those three are committed.

Out of the box performance of IndexWriter is maximized when flushing
by RAM instead of a fixed document count (the default today) because
documents can vary greatly in size.

Likewise, merging performance should be faster when merging by net
segment size since, to minimize the net IO cost of merging segments
over time, you want to merge segments of equal byte size.

Finally, ConcurrentMergeScheduler improves indexing speed
substantially (25% in a simple initial test in LUCENE-870) because it
runs the merges in the backround and doesn't block
add/update/deleteDocument calls.  Most machines have concurrency
between CPU and IO and so it makes sense to default to this
MergeScheduler.

Note that these changes will break users of ParallelReader because the
parallel indices will no longer have matching docIDs.  Such users need
to switch IndexWriter back to flushing by doc count, and switch the
MergePolicy back to LogDocMergePolicy.  It's likely also necessary to
switch the MergeScheduler back to SerialMergeScheduler to ensure
deterministic docID assignment.

I think the combination of these three default changes, plus other
performance improvements for indexing (LUCENE-966, LUCENE-843,
LUCENE-963, LUCENE-969, LUCENE-871, etc.) should make for some sizable
performance gains Lucene 2.3!"

0,"Work around ThreadLocal's ""leak""Java's ThreadLocal is dangerous to use because it is able to take a
surprisingly very long time to release references to the values you
store in it.  Even when a ThreadLocal instance itself is GC'd, hard
references to the values you had stored in it are easily kept for
quite some time later.

While this is not technically a ""memory leak"", because eventually
(when the underlying Map that stores the values cleans up its ""stale""
references) the hard reference will be cleared, and GC can proceed,
its end behavior is not different from a memory leak in that under the
right situation you can easily tie up far more memory than you'd
expect, and then hit unexpected OOM error despite allocating an
extremely large heap to your JVM.

Lucene users have hit this many times.  Here's the most recent thread:

  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-dev/200809.mbox/%3C6e3ae6310809091157j7a9fe46bxcc31f6e63305fcdc%40mail.gmail.com%3E

0,"Optimize PhraseQueryLooking the scorers for PhraseQuery, I think there are some speedups
we could do:

  * The AND part of the scorer (which advances to the next doc that
    has all the terms), in PhraseScorer.doNext, should do the same
    optimizing as BooleanQuery's ConjunctionScorer, ie sort terms from
    rarest to most frequent.  I don't think it should use a linked
    list/firstToLast() that it does today.

  * We do way too much work now when .score() is not called, because
    we go and find all occurrences of the phrase in the doc, whereas
    we should stop only after finding the first and then go and count
    the rest if .score() is called.

  * For the exact case, I think we can use two int arrays to find the
    matches.  The first array holds the count of how many times a term
    in the phrase ""matched"" a phrase starting at that position.  When
    that count == the number of terms in the phrase, it's a match.
    The 2nd is a ""gen"" array (holds docID when that count was last
    touched), to avoid clearing.  Ie when incrementing the count, if
    the docID != gen, we reset count to 0.  I think this'd be faster
    than the PQ we now use.  Downside of this is if you have immense
    docs (position gets very large) we'd need 2 immense arrays.

It'd be great to do LUCENE-1252 along with this, ie factor
PhraseScorer into two AND'd sub-scorers (LUCENE-1252 is open for
this).  The first one should be ConjunctionScorer, and the 2nd one
checks the positions (ie, either the exact or sloppy scorers).  This
would mean if the PhraseQuery is AND'd w/ other clauses (or, a filter
is applied) we would save CPU by not checking the positions for a doc
unless all other AND'd clauses accepted the doc.

0,"Expose FilteredTermsEnum from MTQ MTQ#getEnum() is protected and in order to access it you need to be in the o.a.l.search package. 

here is a relevant snipped from the mailing list discussion

{noformat}
getEnum() is protected so it is intended to be called *only* by subclasses (that's the idea behind protected methods). They are also accessible by other classes from the same package, but that's more a Java bug than a feature. The problem with MTQ is that RewriteMethod is a separate *class* and *not a subclass* of MTQ, so the method cannot be called (it can because of the ""java bug"" called from same package). So theoretically it has to be public otherwise you cannot call getEnum().

Another cleaner fix would be to add a protected final method to RewriteMethod that calls this method from MTQ. So anything subclassing RewriteMethod can get the enum from inside the RewriteMethod class which is the ""correct"" way to handle it. Delegating to MTQ is then ""internal"".

0,"Add support to provide custom classloader for class instantiation from configurationThe configuration framework is based around a BaseConfig class, which provides functionality to instantiate a class whose name is configured in the repository configuration file. Examples of such classes are the FileSystem or the PersistenceManager elements.

The current implementation of the BeanConfig.newInstance() method is to use the ""default classloader"" to load configured classes. That is, the class loader of the BeanConfig class is actually used. This is - generally - the class loader which loads the repository. In certain environments, classes may be provided from outside the core repository class loader. An example fo such an environment is an OSGi setup where each bundle gets its own class laoder, which is separate from all other class loaders except declared by configuration.

I propose to enhance the BeanConfig class as follows:

public class BeanConfig {
 ...
 // Current default class loader, default is BeanConfig's class loader
 private static ClassLoader defaultClassLoader =
BeanConfig.class.getClassLoader();
 // Current instance class loader
 private ClassLoader classLoader;
 ...
 // Sets the default class loader for new BeanConfig instances
 public static void setDefaultClassLoader(ClassLoader loader);
 // Returns the default class loader for new BeanConfig instances
 public static ClassLoader getClassLoader();
 // Sets the class loader of this BeanConfig instance
 public void setClassLoader(ClassLoader loader);
 // Returns the class loader of this BeanConfig instance
 public ClassLoader getClassLoader();
}

The BeanConfig.newInstance method would then use the following to use the class:

public Object newInstance() throws ConfigurationException {
 Class clazz = Class.forName(getClassName(), true, getClassLoader());
 ...
}

0,"Add narrow API for loading stored fields, to replace FieldSelectorI think we should ""invert"" the FieldSelector API, with a ""push"" API
whereby FieldsReader invokes this API once per field in the document

Implementations of the API can then do arbitrary things like save away
the field's size, load the field, clone the IndexInput for later lazy
loading, etc.

This very thin API would be a mirror image of the very thin index time
API we now have (IndexableField) and, importantly, it would have no
dependence on our ""user space"" Document/Field/FieldType impl, so apps
are free to do something totally custom.

After we have this, we should build the ""sugar"" API that rebuilds a
Document instance (ie IR.document(int docID)) on top of this new thin
API.  This'll also be a good test that the API is sufficient.

* # of unique terms within d
* average number of unique terms across field

If we add FieldInvertState.numUniqueTerms, you can incorporate the first two into your norms/docvalues (once we cut over),
the average tf within d being length / numUniqueTerms.

to compute the average across the field, we can just write the sum of all terms' docfreqs into the terms dictionary header,

I made a simple read/write codec that stores all postings data into a
single text file (_X.pst), looking like this:

{noformat}
field contents
  term file
    doc 0
      pos 5
  term is
    doc 0

  term the
    doc 0
      pos 2
  term this
    doc 0

The codec is fully funtional -- all Lucene & Solr tests pass with
-Dtests.codec=SimpleText -- but, its performance is obviously poor.

However, it should be useful for debugging, transparency,

0,"CompoundFileReader's openInput produces streams that may do an extra buffer copySpinoff of LUCENE-888.

The class for reading from a compound file (CompoundFileReader) has a
primary stream which is a BufferedIndexInput when that stream is from
an FSDirectory (which is the norm).  That is one layer of buffering.

Then, when its openInput is called, a CSIndexInput is created which
also subclasses from BufferedIndexInput.  That's a second layer of
buffering.

When a consumer actually uses that CSIndexInput to read, and a call to
readByte or readBytes runs out of what's in the first buffer, it will
go to refill its buffer.  But that refill calls the first
BufferedIndexInput which in turn may refill its buffer (a double
copy) by reading the underlying stream.

Not sure how to fix it yet but we should change things to not do the
extra buffer copy.

    This document has errors that must be fixed before

specific implementation quirks. 

Many, many thanks go to Christian Kohlschuetter for having contributed the
original code. 

I propose SimpleHttpConnection be deprecated and eventually be phased out. I
took the first steps toward this goal by migrating Basic authentication test
cases. I urge all committers and contributors to use SimpleHttpServer for all
the new cases from now on. Ideally in the future we should even be able to get
rid of Tomcat as a dependency for testing.

I also took liberty of tweaking the SimpleHttpServer API a little. I factored
SimpleRequest and SimpleResponse classes out and provided a new interface called
HttpService, which can be used instead of HttpRequestHandler to implement test
cases in a way very similar to writing servlets. 

I'll commit the patch shortly as it does not really touch any _productive_ code.

0,"lucenetestcase ease of use improvementsI started working on this in LUCENE-2658, here is the finished patch.

There are some problems with LuceneTestCase:
* a tests beforeClass, or the test itself (its @befores and its method), might have some
  random behavior, but only the latter can be reproduced with -Dtests.seed
* if you want to do things in beforeClass, you have to use a different API: newDirectory(random)
  instead of newDirectory, etc.
* for a new user, the current output can be verbose, confusing and overwhelming.

So, I refactored this class to address these problems. 
A class still needs 2 seeds internally, as the beforeClass will only run once, 
but the methods or setUp() might run many times, especially when increasing iterations.

but lucenetestcase deals with this, and the ""seed"" is 128-bit (UUID): 
the MSB is initialized in beforeClass, the LSB varied for each method run.
if you provide a seed with a -D, they are both fixed to the UUID you provided.

I fixed the API to be consistent, so you should be able to migrate a test from 
setUp() to beforeClass() [junit3 to junit4] without changing parameters.

The codec, locale, timezone is only printed once at the end if any tests fail, 
as its per-class anyway (setup in beforeClass)

finally, when a test fails, you get a single ""reproduce with"" command line you can copy and paste to reproduce.
this way you dont have to spend time trying to figure out what the command line should be.

0,"queryparser makes all CJK queries phrase queries regardless of analyzerThe queryparser automatically makes *ALL* CJK, Thai, Lao, Myanmar, Tibetan, ... queries into phrase queries, even though you didn't ask for one, and there isn't a way to turn this off.

This completely breaks lucene for these languages, as it treats all queries like 'grep'.

Example: if you query for f:abcd with standardanalyzer, where a,b,c,d are chinese characters, you get a phrasequery of ""a b c d"". if you use cjk analyzer, its no better, its a phrasequery of  ""ab bc cd"", and if you use smartchinese analyzer, you get a phrasequery like ""ab cd"". But the user didn't ask for one, and they cannot turn it off.

The reason is that the code to form phrase queries is not internationally appropriate and assumes whitespace tokenization. If more than one token comes out of whitespace delimited text, its automatically a phrase query no matter what.

The proposed patch fixes the core queryparser (with all backwards compat kept) to only form phrase queries when the double quote operator is used. 

Implementing subclasses can always extend the QP and auto-generate whatever kind of queries they want that might completely break search for languages they don't care about, but core general-purpose QPs should be language independent.

0,"Improve architecture of FieldSortedHitQueuePer the discussion (quite some time ago) on issue LUCENE-806, I'd like to propose an architecture change to the way FieldSortedHitQueue works, and in particular the way it creates SortComparatorSources. I think (I hope) that anyone who looks at the FSHQ code will agree that the class does a lot and much of it's repetitive stuff that really has no business being in that class.

I am about to attach a patch which, in and of itself, doesn't really achieve much that's concrete but does tidy things up a great deal and makes it easier to plug in different behaviours. I then have a subsequent patch which provides a fairly simple and flexible example of how you might replace an implementation, in this case the field-local-String-comparator version from LUCENE-806.

The downside to this patch is that it involved changing the signature of SortComparatorSource.newComparator to take a Locale. There would be ways around this (letting FieldSortedHitQueue take in either a SortComparatorSource or some new, improved interface which takes a Locale (and possibly extends SortComparatorSource). I'm open to this but personally I think that the Locale version makes sense and would suggest that the code would be nicer by breaking the API (and hence targeting this to, presumably, 3.0 at a minimum).

This code does not include specific tests (I will add these, if people like the general idea I'm proposing here) but all current tests pass with this change.

Instead, it should keep the rest of the summary and chop off the title part at the beginning (essentially the opposite). I don't see any benefit to repeating the title in the summary for any case.

In HTMLParser.jj's getSummary():

    String sum = summary.toString().trim();
    String tit = getTitle();
    if (sum.startsWith(tit) || sum.equals(""""))
      return tit;
    else
      return sum;

change it to: (* denotes a line that has changed)

    String sum = summary.toString().trim();
    String tit = getTitle();
*    if (sum.startsWith(tit))             // don't repeat title in summary
*      return sum.substring(tit.length()).trim();

0,"Performance improvement for SegmentMerger.mergeNorms()This patch makes two improvements to SegmentMerger.mergeNorms():

1) When the SegmentMerger merges the norm values it allocates a new byte array to buffer the values for every field of every segment. The size of such an array equals the size of the corresponding segment, so if large segments are being merged, those arrays become very large, too.
We can easily reduce the number of array allocations by reusing a byte array to buffer the norm values that only grows, if a segment is larger than the previous one.

2) Before a norm value is written it is checked if the corresponding document is deleted. If not, the norm is written using IndexOutput.writeByte(byte[]). This patch introduces an optimized case for segments that do not have any deleted docs. In this case the frequent call of IndexReader.isDeleted(int) can be avoided and the more efficient method IndexOutput.writeBytes(byte[], int) can be used.


This patch only changes the method SegmentMerger.mergeNorms(). All unit tests pass."
0,"[PATCH] Avoid checking for TermBuffer in SegmentTermEnum#scanToIt seems that SegmentTermEnum#scanTo is a critical method which is called very often, especially whenever we iterate over a sequence of terms in an index.

When that method is called, the first thing happens is that it checks whether a temporary TermBuffer ""scratch"" has already been initialized.

In fact, this is not necessary. We can simply declare and initialize the ""scratch""-Buffer at the class-level (right now, the initial value is _null_). Java's lazy-loading capabilities allow this without adding any memory footprint for cases where we do not need that buffer.

The attached patch takes care of this. We now save one comparison per term.
In addition to that, the patch renames ""scratch"" to ""scanBuffer"", which aligns with the naming of the other two buffers that are declared in the class."

In other words, after completing the word, we instead traverse min(output) at each node to find the 'shortest path' to the

I think a nice [eventual] model would be if we could simply re-run the

simply some sort of wrapper on the term vectors which are already a

tell us the exact term occurrences that participated in a match (which
I don't think is exposed today).

Due to strange requirements I am using something similar to this (but specialized to our case).
I am doing strange things like forcing multitermqueries to rewrite into boolean queries so they will be highlighted,
and flattening multiphrasequeries into boolean or'ed phrasequeries.
I do not think these things would be 'fast', but i had a few ideas that might help:

* looking at contrib/highlighter, you can support FilteredQuery in flatten() by calling getQuery() right?
* maybe as a last resort, try Query.extractTerms() ?

Currently, we have a special SpanRegexQuery in contrib, and issues like LUCENE-522 open for SpanFuzzyQuery.
The SpanRegexQuery in contrib is a little messy additionally.

For any arbitrary MultiTermQueries to work as a SpanQuery, there are only 3 requirements:
# The un-rewritten query must extend SpanQuery so it can be included in Span clauses
# The rewritten query should be SpanOrQuery instead of BooleanQuery
# The rewritten term clauses should be SpanTermQueries.

Instead of having logic like this for each query, i suggest adding two rewrite methods:
* ScoringSpanBoolean rewrite
* TopTermsSpanBoolean rewrite

as a start i wrote these up, and added a SpanMultiTermQueryWrapper that can be used to wrap any multitermquery this way.
there are a few kinks, but I think the MTQ policeman can probably help get through them.

The following things are left over after LUCENE-584 :

For Lucene 3.0  Filter.bits() will have to be removed.

There is a CHECKME in IndexSearcher about using ConjunctionScorer to have the boolean behaviour of a Filter.

I have not looked into Filter caching yet, but I suppose there will be some room for improvement there.
Iirc the current core has moved to use OpenBitSetFilter and that is probably what is being cached.
In some cases it might be better to cache a SortedVIntList instead.

Boolean logic on DocIdSetIterator is already available for Scorers (that inherit from DocIdSetIterator) in the search package. This is currently implemented by ConjunctionScorer, DisjunctionSumScorer,
ReqOptSumScorer and ReqExclScorer.
Boolean logic on BitSets is available in contrib/misc and contrib/queries

DisjunctionSumScorer calls score() on its subscorers before the score value actually needed.
This could be a reason to introduce a DisjunctionDocIdSetIterator, perhaps as a superclass of DisjunctionSumScorer.

To fully implement non scoring queries a TermDocIdSetIterator will be needed, perhaps as a superclass of TermScorer.

The javadocs in org.apache.lucene.search using matching vs non-zero score:
I'll investigate this soon, and provide a patch when necessary.

An early version of the patches of LUCENE-584 contained a class Matcher,
that differs from the current DocIdSet in that Matcher has an explain() method.
It remains to be seen whether such a Matcher could be useful between
DocIdSet and Scorer.

The semantics of scorer.skipTo(scorer.doc()) was discussed briefly.
This was also discussed at another issue recently, so perhaps it is wortwhile to open a separate issue for this.

Skipping on a SortedVIntList is done using linear search, this could be improved by adding multilevel skiplist info much like in the Lucene index for documents containing a term.

A few complete (test) classes are deprecated, it might be good to add the target release for removal there.

0,"MultiReader.norm() takes up too much memory: norms byte[] should be made into an ObjectMultiReader.norms() is very inefficient: it has to construct a byte array that's as long as all the documents in every segment.  This doubles the memory requirement for scoring MultiReaders vs. Segment Readers.  Although this is cached, it's still a baseline of memory that is unnecessary.

The problem is that the Normalization Factors are passed around as a byte[].  If it were instead replaced with an Object, you could perform a whole host of optimizations
a.  When reading, you wouldn't have to construct a ""fakeNorms"" array of all 1.0fs.  You could instead return a singleton object that would just return 1.0f.
b.  MultiReader could use an object that could delegate to NormFactors of the subreaders
c.  You could write an implementation that could use mmap to access the norm factors.  Or if the index isn't long lived, you could use an implementation that reads directly from the disk.

The patch provided here replaces the use of byte[] with a new abstract class called NormFactors.  
NormFactors has two methods on it
    public abstract byte getByte(int doc) throws IOException;  // Returns the byte[doc]
    public float getFactor(int doc) throws IOException;            // Calls Similarity.decodeNorm(getByte(doc))

There are four implementations of this abstract class
1.  NormFactors.EmptyNormFactors - This replaces the fakeNorms with a singleton that only returns 1.0
2.  NormFactors.ByteNormFactors - Converts a byte[] to a NormFactors for backwards compatibility in constructors.
3.  MultiNormFactors - Multiplexes the NormFactors in MultiReader to prevent the need to construct the gigantic norms array.
4.  SegmentReader.Norm - Same class, but now extends NormFactors to provide the same access.

In addition, Many of the Query and Scorer classes were changes to pass around NormFactors instead of byte[], and to call getFactor() instead of using the byte[].  I have kept around IndexReader.norms(String) for backwards compatibiltiy, but marked it as deprecated.  I believe that the use of ByteNormFactors in IndexReader.getNormFactors() will keep backward compatibility with other IndexReader implementations, but I don't know how to test that.

0,"Separate SegmentReaders (and other atomic readers) from composite IndexReadersWith current trunk, whenever you open an IndexReader on a directory you get back a DirectoryReader which is a composite reader. The interface of IndexReader has now lots of methods that simply throw UOE (in fact more than 50% of all methods that are commonly used ones are unuseable now). This confuses users and makes the API hard to understand.

This issue should split ""atomic readers"" from ""reader collections"" with a separate API. After that, you are no longer able, to get TermsEnum without wrapping from those composite readers. We currently have helper classes for wrapping (SlowMultiReaderWrapper - please rename, the name is really ugly; or Multi*), those should be retrofitted to implement the correct classes (SlowMultiReaderWrapper would be an atomic reader but takes a composite reader as ctor param, maybe it could also simply take a List<AtomicReader>). In my opinion, maybe composite readers could implement some collection APIs and also have the ReaderUtil method directly built in (possibly as a ""view"" in the util.Collection sense). In general composite readers do not really need to look like the previous IndexReaders, they could simply be a ""collection"" of SegmentReaders with some functionality like reopen.

On the other side, atomic readers do not need reopen logic anymore? When a segment changes, you need a new atomic reader? - maybe because of deletions thats not the best idea, but we should investigate. Maybe make the whole reopen logic simplier to use (ast least on the collection reader level).

0,"refactor HttpClientConnection and HttpProxyConnectionInstead of trying to define a full abstraction for client connections, let's define only a minimal interface in HttpCore with only those methods actually needed in the core. In particular, the core does not need to open connections (since HTTPCORE-11), and it does not care whether a connection is direct or through a proxy. An abstraction for client connections can be defined in HttpConn.

(original description:)
As discussed on the mailing list, separating the responsibility for establishing connections from the connection objects could improve the design and help with proxy support.

0,"SnowballAnalyzer lacks a constructor that takes a Set of Stop WordsAs discussed on the java-user list, the SnowballAnalyzer has been updated to use a Set of stop words. However, there is no constructor which accepts a Set, there's only the original String[] one

This is an issue, because most of the common sources of stop words (eg StopAnalyzer) have deprecated their String[] stop word lists, and moved over to Sets (eg StopAnalyzer.ENGLISH_STOP_WORDS_SET). So, for now, you either have to use a deprecated field on StopAnalyzer, or manually turn the Set into an array so you can pass it to the SnowballAnalyzer

I would suggest that a constructor is added to SnowballAnalyzer which accepts a Set. Not sure if the old String[] one should be deprecated or not.

A sample patch against 2.9.1 to add the constructor is:

0,Improved error reporting from JcrUtils.getRepositoryThe service provider mechanism and the null return value used by the RepositoryFactory API makes it a bit difficult to troubleshoot cases where a repository can not be accessed. It would be helpful if the JcrUtils.getRepository methods reported as accurate failure information as possible in case the requested repository is not found.
0,"Improve InfoStream class in trunk to be more consistent with logging-frameworks like slf4j/log4j/commons-loggingFollowup on a [thread by Shai Erea on java-dev@lao|http://lucene.472066.n3.nabble.com/IndexWriter-infoStream-is-final-td3537485.html]: I already discussed with Robert about that, that there is one thing missing. Currently the IW only checks if the infoStream!=null and then passes the message to the method, and that *may* ignore it. For your requirement it is the case that this is enabled or disabled dynamically. Unfortunately if the construction of the message is heavy, then this wastes resources.

I would like to add another method to this class: abstract boolean isEnabled() that can also be implemented. I would then replace all null checks in IW by this method. The default config in IW would be changed to use a NoOutputInfoStream that returns false here and ignores the message.

A simple logger wrapper for e.g. log4j / slf4j then could look like (ignoring component, could be enabled):

{code:java}
Loger log = YourLoggingFramework.getLogger(IndexWriter.class);

public void message(String component, String message) {
  log.debug(component + "": "" + message);
}

public boolean isEnabled(String component) {
  return log.isDebugEnabled();
}
{code}

Using this you could enable/disable logging live by e.g. the log4j management console of your app server by enabling/disabling IndexWriter.class logging.

The changes are really simple:
- PrintStreamInfoStream returns true, always, mabye make it dynamically enable/disable to allow Shai's request
- infoStream.getDefault() is never null and can never be set to null. Instead the default is a singleton NoOutputInfoStream that returns false of isEnabled(component).
- All null checks on infoStream should be replaced by infoStream.isEanbled(component), this is possible as always != null. There are no slowdowns by this - it's like Collections.emptyList() instead stupid null checks."

0,"Use bulk-byte-copy when merging term vectorsIndexing all of Wikipedia, with term vectors on, under the YourKit
profiler, shows that 26% of the time (!!) was spent merging the
vectors.  This was without offsets & positions, which would make
matters even worse.

Depressingly, merging, even with ConcurrentMergeScheduler, cannot in
fact keep up with the flushing of new segments in this test, and this
is on a strong IO system (Mac Pro with 4 drive RAID 0 array, 4 CPU
cores).

So, just like Robert's idea to merge stored fields with bulk copying
whenever the field name->number mapping is ""congruent"" (LUCENE-1043),
we can do the same with term vectors.

It's a little trickier because the term vectors format doesn't quite
make it easy to bulk-copy because it doesn't directly encode the
offset into the tvf file.

I worked out a patch that changes the tvx format slightly, by storing
the absolute position in the tvf file for the start of each document
into the tvx file, just like it does for tvd now.  This adds an extra
8 bytes (long) in the tvx file, per document.

Then, I removed a vLong (the first ""position"" stored inside the tvd
file), which makes tvd contents fully position independent (so you can
just copy the bytes).

This adds up to 7 bytes per document (less for larger indices) that
have term vectors enabled, but I think this small increase in index
size is acceptable for the gains in indexing performance?

With this change, the time spent merging term vectors dropped from 26%
to 3%.  Of course, this only applies if your documents are ""regular"".
I think in the future we could have Lucene try hard to assign the same
field number for a given field name, if it had been seen before in the
index...

Merging terms now dominates the merge cost (~20% over overall time
building the Wikipedia index).

I also beefed up TestBackwardsCompatibility unit test: test a non-CFS
and a CFS of versions 1.9, 2.0, 2.1, 2.2 index formats, and added some
term vector fields to these indices.

0,"User-defined ProtocolSocketFactory for secure connection through proxyI use a custom socket implementation with HttpClient, and am having problems 
getting secure connections through a proxy working.

HttpClient requires that my SecureProtocolSocketFactory be able to create a 
secure socket layered over an existing insecure socket, but does not specify 
how that insecure socket is created. Currently, for secure proxied 
connections, the insecure connection is always created using a 
DefaultProtocolSocketFactory (HttpConnection.java, line 702). I wish to be 
able to override this behaviour, so that I can create the insecure socket 
using my own custom implementation.

The problem with the default behaviour is that my custom socket implementation 
is written in C++ using JNI, and the SSL implementation is handled at the 
native level. Hence, layering over an existing JDK socket will not work.

My proposed solution is to add an HTTP connection parameter to specify the 
socket factory to use, perhaps http.connection.insecuresocketfactory of type

0,"Post grouping facetingThis issues focuses on implementing post grouping faceting.
* How to handle multivalued fields. What field value to show with the facet.
* Where the facet counts should be based on
** Facet counts can be based on the normal documents. Ungrouped counts. 
** Facet counts can be based on the groups. Grouped counts.
** Facet counts can be based on the combination of group value and facet value. Matrix counts.   

And properly more implementation options.

The first two methods are implemented in the SOLR-236 patch. For the first option it calculates a DocSet based on the individual documents from the query result. For the second option it calculates a DocSet for all the most relevant documents of a group. Once the DocSet is computed the FacetComponent and StatsComponent use one the DocSet to create facets and statistics.  

This last one is a bit more complex. I think it is best explained with an example. Lets say we search on travel offers:
|||hotel||departure_airport||duration||
|Hotel a|AMS|5
|Hotel a|DUS|10
|Hotel b|AMS|5
|Hotel b|AMS|10

If we group by hotel and have a facet for airport. Most end users expect (according to my experience off course) the following airport facet:
AMS: 2
DUS: 1

The above result can't be achieved by the first two methods. You either get counts AMS:3 and DUS:1 or 1 for both airports."

In order to avoid having very many long-living PostingList objects in TermsHashPerField we want to switch to parallel arrays.  The termsHash will simply be a int[] which maps each term to dense termIDs.

All data that the PostingList classes currently hold will then we placed in parallel arrays, where the termID is the index into the arrays.  This will avoid the need for object pooling, will remove the overhead of object initialization and garbage collection.  Especially garbage collection should benefit significantly when the JVM runs out of memory, because in such a situation the gc mark times can get very long if there is a big number of long-living objects in memory.

Another benefit could be to build more efficient TermVectors.  We could avoid the need of having to store the term string per document in the TermVector.  Instead we could just store the segment-wide termIDs.  This would reduce the size and also make it easier to implement efficient algorithms that use TermVectors, because no term mapping across documents in a segment would be necessary.

This is no problem if you are an ant user, but if you are an IDE user you need to carefully configure the order of your classpath or things will not compile, as these will override the ones in the Solr libs, for example.

The solution is to upgrade the tidy.jar to the newest one that only includes org.w3c.tidy and doesn't cause these problems."
0,"bad assumptions on QueryResult.getIterator() semantics in QueryResultNodeIteratorTest.testSkip()testSkip() assumes that calling getIterator() a second time will return a new iterator of the same size. JSR-170 is silent on this. Forcing a server to implement this essantially means that the query result must be cached until there's no reference to QueryResult anymore.

As this is a test of skip(), not getIterator(), the test should really refetch a new QueryResult in order to obtain a new iterator.

(Note: The issue of the semantics of QueryResult.getIterator should be discussed by the JCR EG.)

0,"Internal Timeout Handling in the TransactionContext is not XA Spec. conformThe problem here is that in a 2 phase transaction the xa spec does not  
permit a RB* return code in response to xa_commit().  The xa spec says  
the following about RB* return codes in the xa_commit() section:        
                                                                        
""The resource manager did not commit the work done on behalf of the     
transaction branch.  Upon return, the resource manager has rolled back  
the branch?s work and has released all held resources.  These values may
be returned only if TMONEPHASE is set in flags""                         
                                                                        
Essentially, the only two return codes from xa_commit that J2EE Containers can     
handle sensibly are XA_OK (normal case) and XA_RMFAIL.  RMFAIL will     
cause the containers to retry to commit the  transaction.  Any other return code will result in a heuristic          
transaction outcome (non-atomic).  

In a xa environment the TMONEPHASE is not set on the flags and so XA_RBTIMEOUT is 
not a permitted return code. A Container  transaction service cannot do anything to ensure an atomic     
outcome if an XAResource fails to honour its promise to be able to commit it made when it answer XA_OK in response to xa_prepare(). 

The internal timeout handling will rollback the Jackrabbit XAResource if the time exceeds between prepare and commit.
and in the commit Method will always throw a XA_RBTIMEOUT.

We should not handle the timeout internal because this should make the container in a 2 Phase transaction."

0,"CMS merge throttling is not aggressive enoughI hit this crab while working on the NRT benchmarker (in luceneutil).

CMS today forcefully idles any incoming threads, when there are too many merges pending.

This is the last line of defense that it has, since it also juggles thread priorities (and forcefully idles the biggest merges) to try to reduce the outstanding merge count.

But when it cannot keep up it has no choice but to stall those threads responsible for making new segments.

However, the logic is in the wrong place now -- the stalling happens after pulling the next merge from IW.  This is poor because it means if you have N indexing threads, you allow max + N outstanding merges.

I have a simple fix, which is to just move the stall logic to before we pull the next merge from IW."
0,"Add reflection API to AttributeSource/AttributeImplAttributeSource/TokenStream inspection in Solr needs to have some insight into the contents of AttributeImpls. As LUCENE-2302 has some problems with toString() [which is not structured and conflicts with CharSequence's definition for CharTermAttribute], I propose an simple API that get a default implementation in AttributeImpl (just like toString() current):

- Iterator<Map.Entry<String,?>> AttributeImpl.contentsIterator() returns an iterator (for most attributes its a singleton) of a key-value pair, e.g. ""term""->""foobar"",""startOffset""->Integer.valueOf(0),...
- AttributeSource gets the same method, it just concat the iterators of each getAttributeImplsIterator() AttributeImpl

No backwards problems occur, as the default toString() method will work like before (it just gets iterator and lists), but we simply remove the documentation for the format. (Char)TermAttribute gets a special impl fo toString() according to CharSequence and a corresponding iterator.

I also want to remove the abstract hashCode() and equals() methods from AttributeImpl, as they are not needed and just create work for the implementor."

To make IDE integration smoother it would be nice if precompiled copies of the Java files existed the src/main/java folder.

Precompiling the sources would also allow us to avoid the JavaCC processing step during each Jackrabbit build. Instead we could have a separate profile for explicitly recompiling the JavaCC sources when they have been modified. In the past three years that has happened only once (JCR-952), so I think a bit of extra complexity there is justified by the simplification we can achieve in normal builds and IDE integration."

0,"auto close idle connectionsThis has been mentioned several times on the mailing list (most recently here:
http://nagoya.apache.org/eyebrowse/ReadMsg?listName=commons-httpclient-dev@jakarta.apache.org&msgNo=5191
)
It is desirable for the http client to close it's connection after some
configurable idle time. Failing to do so causes the server (and every TCP
resource in between) to keep the socket open and possibly run out of resources
under load.

The HTTP 1.1 RFC has this to say under section 8.1.4:
Servers will usually have some time-out value beyond which they will
   no longer maintain an inactive connection. Proxy servers might make
   this a higher value since it is likely that the client will be making
   more connections through the same server. The use of persistent
   connections places no requirements on the length (or existence) of
   this time-out for either the client or the server.

   When a client or server wishes to time-out it SHOULD issue a graceful
   close on the transport connection. Clients and servers SHOULD both
   constantly watch for the other side of the transport close, and
   respond to it as appropriate. If a client or server does not detect
   the other side's close promptly it could cause unnecessary resource
   drain on the network.

The first sentence of the 2nd paragraph is interesting: how is the client
supposed to do a ""graceful close""? Does it simply mean closing the socket?
One possiblity may be to issue a HTTP/OPTIONS * request with a Connection:close
header."

0,"Restructure codec hierarchySpinoff of LUCENE-2621. (Hoping we can do some of the renaming etc here in a rote way to make progress).

Currently Codec.java only represents a portion of the index, but there are other parts of the index 
(stored fields, term vectors, fieldinfos, ...) that we want under codec control. There is also some 
inconsistency about what a Codec is currently, for example Memory and Pulsing are really just 
PostingsFormats, you might just apply them to a specific field. On the other hand, PreFlex actually
is a Codec: it represents the Lucene 3.x index format (just not all parts yet). I imagine we would
like SimpleText to be the same way.

So, I propose restructuring the classes so that we have something like:
* CodecProvider <-- dead, replaced by java ServiceProvider mechanism. All indexes are 'readable' if codecs are in classpath.
* Codec <-- represents the index format (PostingsFormat + FieldsFormat + ...)
* PostingsFormat: this is what Codec controls today, and Codec will return one of these for a field.
* FieldsFormat: Stored Fields + Term Vectors + FieldInfos?

I think for PreFlex, it doesnt make sense to expose its PostingsFormat as a 'public' class, because preflex
can never be per-field so there is no use in allowing you to configure PreFlex for a specific field.
Similarly, I think in the future we should do the same thing for SimpleText. Nobody needs SimpleText for production, it should
just be a Codec where we try to make as much of the index as plain text and simple as possible for debugging/learning/etc.
So we don't need to expose its PostingsFormat. On the other hand, I don't think we need Pulsing or Memory codecs,
because its pretty silly to make your entire index use one of their PostingsFormats. To parallel with analysis:
PostingsFormat is like Tokenizer and Codec is like Analyzer, and we don't need Analyzers to ""show off"" every Tokenizer.

we can also move the baked in PerFieldCodecWrapper out (it would basically be PerFieldPostingsFormat). Privately it would
write the ids to the file like it does today. in the future, all 3.x hairy backwards code would move to PreflexCodec. 
SimpleTextCodec would get a plain text fieldinfos impl, etc."

0,"Factor out ByteSliceWriter from DocumentsWriterFieldDataDocumentsWriter uses byte slices into shared byte[]'s to hold the
growing postings data for many different terms in memory.  This is
probably the trickiest (most confusing) part of DocumentsWriter.

Right now it's not cleanly factored out and not easy to separately
test.  In working on this issue:

  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200805.mbox/%3c126142c0805061426n1168421ya5594ef854fae5e4@mail.gmail.com%3e

which eventually turned out to be a bug in Oracle JRE's JIT compiler,
I factored out ByteSliceWriter and created a unit test to stress test
the writing & reading of byte slices.  The test just randomly writes N
streams interleaved into shared byte[]'s, then reads them back
verifying the results are correct.

I created the stress test to try to find any bugs in that code.  The
test ran fine (no bugs were found) but I think the refactoring is
still very much worthwhile.

0,"Tokenizers (which are the source of Tokens) should call AttributeSource.clearAttributes() firstThis is a followup for LUCENE-1796:
{quote}
Token.clear() used to be called by the consumer... but then it was switched to the producer here: LUCENE-1101 
I don't know if all of the Tokenizers in lucene were ever changed, but in any case it looks like at least some of these bugs were introduced with the switch to the attribute API - for example StandardTokenizer did clear it's reusableToken... and now it doesn't.
{quote}

As alternative to changing all core/contrib Tokenizers to call clearAttributes first, we could do this in the indexer, what would be a overhead for old token streams that itsself clear their reusable token. This issue should also update the Javadocs, to clearly state inside Tokenizer.java, that the source TokenStream (normally the Tokenizer) should clear *all* Attributes. If it does not do it and e.g. the positionIncrement is changed to 0 by any TokenFilter, but the filter does not change it back to 1, the TokenStream would stay with 0. If the TokenFilter would call PositionIncrementAttribute.clear() (because he is responsible), it could also break the TokenStream, because clear() is a general method for the whole attribute instance. If e.g. Token is used as AttributeImpl, a call to clear() would also clear offsets and termLength, which is not wanted. So the source of the Tokenization should rest the attributes to default values.

LUCENE-1796 removed the iterator creation cost, so clearAttributes should run fast, but is an additional cost during Tokenization, as it was not done consistently before, so a small speed degradion is caused by this, but has nothing to do with the new TokenStream API."

0,"Avoidable synchronization bottleneck in MatchAlldocsQuery$MatchAllScorerThe isDeleted() method on IndexReader has been mentioned a number of times as a potential synchronization bottleneck. However, the reason this  bottleneck occurs is actually at a higher level that wasn't focused on (at least in the threads I read).

In every case I saw where a stack trace was provided to show the lock/block, higher in the stack you see the MatchAllScorer.next() method. In Solr paricularly, this scorer is used for ""NOT"" queries. We saw incredibly poor performance (order of magnitude) on our load tests for NOT queries, due to this bottleneck. The problem is that every single document is run through this isDeleted() method, which is synchronized. Having an optimized index exacerbates this issues, as there is only a single SegmentReader to synchronize on, causing a major thread pileup waiting for the lock.

By simply having the MatchAllScorer see if there have been any deletions in the reader, much of this can be avoided. Especially in a read-only environment for production where you have slaves doing all the high load searching.

I modified line 67 in the MatchAllDocsQuery
FROM:
  if (!reader.isDeleted(id)) {
TO:
  if (!reader.hasDeletions() || !reader.isDeleted(id)) {

In our micro load test for NOT queries only, this was a major performance improvement.  We also got the same query results. I don't believe this will improve the situation for indexes that have deletions. 

Please consider making this adjustment for a future bug fix release.

After the web browser has the authentication credentials for a given host, port

0,"Performance improvement: Lazy skipping on proximity fileHello,

I'm proposing a patch here that changes org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentTermPositions to avoid unnecessary skips and reads on the proximity stream. Currently a call of next() or seek(), which causes a movement to a document in the freq file also moves the prox pointer to the posting list of that document.  But this is only necessary if actual positions have to be retrieved for that particular document. 

Consider for example a phrase query with two terms: the freq pointer for term 1 has to move to document x to answer the question if the term occurs in that document. But *only* if term 2 also matches document x, the positions have to be read to figure out if term 1 and term 2 appear next to each other in document x and thus satisfy the query. 

A move to the posting list of a document can be quite expensive. It has to be skipped to the last skip point before that document and then the documents between the skip point and the desired document have to be scanned, which means that the VInts of all positions of those documents have to be read and decoded. 

An improvement is to move the prox pointer lazily to a document only if nextPosition() is called. This will become even more important in the future when the size of the proximity file increases (e. g. by adding payloads to the posting lists).

My patch implements this lazy skipping. All unit tests pass. 


I also attach a new unit test that works as follows:
Using a RamDirectory an index is created and test docs are added. Then the index is optimized to make sure it only has a single segment. This is important, because IndexReader.open() returns an instance of SegmentReader if there is only one segment in the index. The proxStream instance of SegmentReader is package protected, so it is possible to set proxStream to a different object. I am using a class called SeeksCountingStream that extends IndexInput in a way that it is able to count the number of invocations of seek(). 

Then the testcase searches the index using a PhraseQuery ""term1 term2"". It is known how many documents match that query and the testcase can verify that seek() on the proxStream is not called more often than number of search hits.

Example:
Number of docs in the index: 500
Number of docs that match the query ""term1 term2"": 5

Invocations of seek on prox stream (old code): 29
Invocations of seek on prox stream (patched version): 5

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- reduce QName to its core functionality and put conversion from and to JCR name to
  a separate class 'NameFormat'
- in order not to break existing code, all methods that deal with the conversion in QName
  are marked deprecated.
- add constant for the name of the root node.

Path
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- reduce Path to its core functionality and put conversion from and to JCR path to
  a separate class 'PathFormat'
- in order not to break existing code, all methods that deal with the conversion in Path
  are marked deprecated.
- introduce new constants for UNDEFINED_INDEX (0) and DEFAULT_INDEX (1), that
   are currently hardcoded throughout  the jackrabbit project.
- new method Path.getElement(int) [PathElement]
- make PathElement constants public (used by PathFormat)

Path.PathBuilder
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- additional constructor  PathBuilder(Path)

Path.PathElement
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add PathElement.getNormalizedIndex() that always asserts a 1-based index.
- change subclasses to be private (no usage within the jackrabbit, except inside Path).

PathMap
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- move o.a.j.core.PathMap  to o.a.j.util.PathMap in order to make it available in the
  commons module.

NamespaceResolver
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add methods for resolution of paths:
   > getQPath(String jcrPath) [Path]
   > getJCRPath(Path qPath) [String]

NamespaceListener
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- add method 'namespaceRemove(String)'

ValueHelper
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
currently  JCR value objects are 'manually' created in the ValueHelper despite the
fact, that JSR170 defines a ValueFactory interface. Consequently the ValueHelper
present in the commons module can only be used by implementations that use
the same value implementations.

- add new helper methods that take a ValueFactory as argument.
- in order not to break existing code the original methods are marked deprecated and
  may be removed at a later time.

consequently:
- modify signature of  InternalValue.create that include a value conversion to take a
  ValueFactory param and adjust all usages inside the core package.

ValueFactoryImpl
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- createValue(String, int ): used to call the conversion on ValueHelper. with the 
   changes suggested to ValueHelper, the code must be changed in order to
   created instances of the Value implementations within the factory.
- together with the modification to ValueHelper, stefan suggested to replace the public 
  constructor with a static 'getInstance' method. All usages within jackrabbit.core, were
   modified accordingly.

2) The server currently computes lock tokens for session-scoped locks based on the node id; these are not valid JCR lock tokens though and cause exceptions when they are re-added when they appear in a Lock-Token header or an If header. This will likely cause requests to fail that use both types of locks (yes, maybe academic but should be fixed anyway)

Proposal:

a) Map lock tokens to oqaquelocktoken URIs, using a constant UUID plus a postfix encoding the original lock token
b) Use a syntax that allows to distinguish between tokens for open-scoped locks or session-scoped locks, so that we do not try to add the latter type to the Session (alternatively, handle exceptions doing so gracefully)"

HttpConnection and it uses the Socket(host,port) constructor which tries to
connect write away.  I'd like to suggest the following code below so the timeout

0,"Configuration of CacheManager memory sizes(I already posted this as comments under JCR-619.)

The maximum size for all caches in CacheManager is hardcoded to 16 megabytes and there's no way to change that. It would be nice if this as well as other CacheManager parameters were configurable. It's just a waste running Jackrabbit on a server with gigabytes of memory and only using 16 megabytes for cache...

I have created a really simple and straightforward patch (jackrabbit-cachemanager-config.patch) which enables reaching the CacheManager instance through RepositoryImpl object and setting all three of its memory parameters. The memory parameters are no longer static constants, but instance fields getting initial values from constants (so the default behavior of the class remains the same).

(It would be even nicer if these parameters were configurable via configuration files, but that should probably be implemented by someone close to the project.)"

0,"Separate javadocs for core and contribsA while ago we had a discussion on java-dev about separating the javadocs
for the contrib modules instead of having only one big javadoc containing

This patch:
* Adds new targets to build.xml: 
  ** ""javadocs-all"" Generates Javadocs for the core, demo, and contrib 
    classes
  ** ""javadocs-core"" Generates Javadocs for the core classes
  ** ""javadocs-demo"" Generates Javadocs for the demo classes
  ** ""javadocs-contrib"" Using contrib-crawl it generates the Javadocs for 
    all contrib modules, except ""similarity"" (currently empty) and gdata.
* Adds submenues to the Javadocs link on the Lucene site with links to
  the different javadocs
* Includes the javadocs in the maven artifacts

Remarks:
- I removed the ant target ""javadocs-internal"", because I didn't want to
  add corresponding targets for all new javadocs target. Instead I 
  defined a new property ""javadoc.access"", so now  
  ""ant -Djavadoc.access=package"" can be used in combination with any of
  the javadocs targets. Is this ok?
- I didn't include gdata (yet) because it uses build files that don't 
  extend Lucenes standard build files.

0,"Some improvements to _TestUtil and its usageI've started this issue because I've noticed that _TestUtil.getRandomMultiplier() is called from many loops' condition check, sometimes hundreds and thousands of times. Each time it does Integer.parseInt after calling System.getProperty. This really can become a constant IMO, either in LuceneTestCase(J4) or _TestUtil, as it's not expected to change while tests are running ...

I then reviewed the class and spotted some more things that I think can be fixed/improved:
# getTestCodec() can become a constant as well
# arrayToString is marked deprecated. I've checked an no one calls them, so I'll delete them. This is a 4.0 code branch + a test-only class. No need to deprecate anything.
# getTempDir calls new Random(), instead of newRandom() in LuceneTestCaseJ4, which means that if something fails, we won't know the random seed used ...
#* In that regard, we might want to output all the classes that obtained a static seed in reportAdditionalFailures(), instead of just the class that ran the test.
# rmDir(String) can be removed IMO, and leave only rmDir(File)
# I suggest we include some recursion in rmDir(File) to handle the deletion of nested directories.
#* Also, it does not check whether the dir deletion itself succeeds (but it does so for the files). This can bite us on Windows, if some test did not close things properly.

I'll work out a patch."
0,"Position based TermVectorMapperAs part of the new TermVectorMapper approach to TermVectors, the ensuing patch loads term vectors and stores the term info by position.  This should let people directly index into a term vector given a position.  Actually, it does it through Maps, b/c the array based bookkeeping is a pain given the way positions are stored.  

The map looks like:
Map<String,   Map<Integer, TVPositionInfo>>

where the String is the field name, the integer is the position, and TVPositionInfo is a storage mechanism for the terms and offsets that occur at a position.  It _should_ handle multiple terms per position (which is always my downfall! )

I have not tested performance of this approach.

0,"Make the extraction of Session UserIDs from Subjects configurableThe SessionImpl class must extract a string name from the Prinicpals in a Subject to use as the Session userID.  In 1.4 the SessionImpl class directly selects the first available Principal.  In 1.5, this is delegated to the SecurityManager, which chooses the first  non-group principal.

It would be useful to be able to configure specific selection criteria for the Principal used for the Session userID.  A simple mechanism would involve specifying a Principal implementation classname in the configuration, and the first instance of that class found in the Subject would be used for the userID.  One way to implement this in 1.4 would be to extend AuthContext to include a method getSessionPrincipal() which encapsulates the selection logic, and adding an option the LoginModuleConfig to specify the class name of the Principal to select.

A particular use case is using the LDAP LoginModule from Sun JDK 6 with the repository.  The first Principal LdapLoginModule populates into the Subject is an instance of LdapPrincipal, which renders the userID as the full DN of the user.  The LoginModule also adds an instance of UserPrincipal, whose name is the simple username/uid attribute, which would be more appropriate as the Session userId since it corresponds to the username provided by the user to application authentication mechanisms (the provided username is expanded into the full DN prior to authentication by the login module).  If the above configuration mechanism were available, one could configure the LdapLoginModule, and specify that the userID be extracted from the first instance of com.sun.security.auth.UserPrincipal.  Since rewriting LoginModules is not always possible or desirable, this change would enable the stable integration of 3rd-party login modules that may populate the Subject with several principals."
0,"Credentials ignored if realm specified in preemptive authenticationWhen you specifiy credentials for a specific realm using preemptive

...
HttpClient client = new HttpClient(manager);
client.getState().setCredentials(""myRealm"",""myHost"",
			new UsernamePasswordCredentials(
				""user"",""password""));
client.getState().setAuthenticationPreemptive(true); 
...

""myRealm"" will be ignored in HttpState's matchCredentials() private method 
because during preemptive authentication, it is called with a null realm:

 private static Credentials matchCredentials(HashMap map, String realm, String 
host) {
        HttpAuthRealm entry = new HttpAuthRealm(host, realm);
	// no possible match here, map only contains the version with the realm
        Credentials creds = (Credentials) map.get(entry);
        if (creds == null && host != null && realm != null) {

            creds = (Credentials) map.get(DEFAULT_AUTH_REALM);

        return creds;
    } 

This is quite logical since the realm comes from the server and you don't 
contact the server first during preemptive authentication.

But, it should not be possible to set a realm when using preemptive mode, or at 
least it should not be silently ignored.

The current workaround is to set the realm to null in setCredential(), no 
elegant but works.

readers from IndexWriter.

The problem is, when cloning, we create a new [thin] cloned
SegmentReader for each segment.  FieldCache keys directly off this
object, so if you clone the reader and do a search that requires the
FieldCache (eg, sorting) then that first search is always very slow
because every single segment is reloading the FieldCache.

This is of course a complete showstopper for LUCENE-1516.

We rely on WeakHashMap to hold our FieldCache, keyed by reader.  But this lacks immediacy on releasing the reference, after a reader is closed.

WeakHashMap can't free the key until the reader is no longer referenced by the app. And, apparently, WeakHashMap has a further impl detail that requires invoking one of its methods for it to notice that a key has just become only weakly reachable.

To fix this, I think on IR.close we should evict entries from the FieldCache, as long as the sub-readers are truly closed (refCount dropped to 0)."

•	an identifier segment, U, where U is a JCR identifier.
•	the root segment.

- expanded name segments
- trailing /
- index [1]

Identifier-segments
- get resolved upon being passed to any API calls that take path to an existing Node
- don't get resolved when being used to create a PATH value object.

Except for PATH values, all jcr paths returned by the API are normalized and standard, thus never identifier-based.

PATH values in contrast:
- must be converted to standard form
- must NOT be normalized. i.e. redundant segments and identifiers must be preserved.

  public void setDateResolution(String fieldName, DateTools.Resolution dateResolution);

(I also added the corresponding getter methods).

Now the user can set a default date resolution used for all fields or, with the second method, field specific date resolutions.

0,"XMLPersistenceManager fails after creating too many directories on linuxWhen using the  XMLPersistenceManager it creates a bunch of directories in jackrabbit/home/version/data. Eventually I reach 32000 directories in the data directory and subsequent writes fail.

I believe this is caused by XMLPersistenceManager.buildNodeFolderPath() method where it does 
   if (cnt == 4 || cnt == 8) {
      sb.append('/');
   }

This causes the subdirectories to be 4 characters, 0-f i.e. 16^4 which is 65536, if what I'm seeing is correct, on linux ext3, it's limited to 32000 entries. If the XMLPersistence manager used 2 or 3 characters this should fix the problem, or if it were configurable it would also solve this (I think).

an 
   ls jackrabbit/home/version/data | wc -l
returns 
   32001

0,"CookieIdentityComparator and CookiePathComparator could/should implement SerializableCookieIdentityComparator and CookiePathComparator could/should implement Serializable

As Findbugs suggests:

""Comparator doesn't implement Serializable

This class implements the Comparator interface. You should consider whether or not it should also implement the Serializable interface. If a comparator is used to construct an ordered collection such as a TreeMap, then the TreeMap will be serializable only if the comparator is also serializable. As most comparators have little or no state, making them serializable is generally easy and good defensive programming. ""

Neither class has any state, so implementing Serializable would be trivial.

Oleg did some further investigation and found that DefaultRequestDirector also has the same problem.

A simple solution would be to make the Log a static member variable, and do this on all classes for consistency.  However this might not be the best solution for interoperating with some frameworks (see http://wiki.apache.org/jakarta-commons/Logging/StaticLog)

Another solution would be to simply remove the Log from the affected classes, although they are presumably there for a reason...

0,"Lucene Search not scallingI've noticed that when doing thousands of searches in a single thread the average time is quite low i.e. a few milliseconds. When adding more concurrent searches doing exactly the same search the average time increases drastically. 
I've profiled the search classes and found that the whole of lucene blocks on 

org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentCoreReaders.getTermsReader
org.apache.lucene.util.VirtualMethod
  public synchronized int getImplementationDistance 
org.apache.lucene.util.AttributeSourcew.getAttributeInterfaces

These cause search times to increase from a few milliseconds to up to 2 seconds when doing 500 concurrent searches on the same in memory index. Note: That the index is not being updates at all, so not refresh methods are called at any stage.


Some questions:
  Why do we need synchronization here?
  There must be a non-lockable solution for these, they basically cause lucene to be ok for single thread applications but disastrous for any concurrent implementation.

I'll do some experiments by removing the synchronization from the methods of these classes."

0,"Create new method optimize(int maxNumSegments) in IndexWriterSpinning this out from the discussion in LUCENE-847.

I think having a way to ""slightly optimize"" your index would be useful
for many applications.

The current optimize() call is very expensive for large indices
because it always optimizes fully down to 1 segment.  If we add a new
method which instead is allowed to stop optimizing once it has <=
maxNumSegments segments in the index, this would allow applications to
eg optimize down to say <= 10 segments after doing a bunch of updates.
This should be a nice compromise of gaining good speedups of searching
while not spending the full (and typically very high) cost of
optimizing down to a single segment.

Since LUCENE-847 is now formalizing an API for decoupling merge policy
from IndexWriter, if we want to add this new optimize method we need
to take it into account in LUCENE-847.

0,"contrib intelligent Analyzer for ChineseI wrote a Analyzer for apache lucene for analyzing sentences in Chinese language. it's called ""imdict-chinese-analyzer"", the project on google code is here: http://code.google.com/p/imdict-chinese-analyzer/

In Chinese, ""我是中国人""(I am Chinese), should be tokenized as ""我""(I)   ""是""(am)   ""中国人""(Chinese), not ""我"" ""是中"" ""国人"". So the analyzer must handle each sentence properly, or there will be mis-understandings everywhere in the index constructed by Lucene, and the accuracy of the search engine will be affected seriously!

Although there are two analyzer packages in apache repository which can handle Chinese: ChineseAnalyzer and CJKAnalyzer, they take each character or every two adjoining characters as a single word, this is obviously not true in reality, also this strategy will increase the index size and hurt the performance baddly.

The algorithm of imdict-chinese-analyzer is based on Hidden Markov Model (HMM), so it can tokenize chinese sentence in a really intelligent way. Tokenizaion accuracy of this model is above 90% according to the paper ""HHMM-based Chinese Lexical analyzer ICTCLAL"" while other analyzer's is about 60%.

As imdict-chinese-analyzer is a really fast and intelligent. I want to contribute it to the apache lucene repository."
0,"Some house cleaning in addIndexes*Today, the use of addIndexes and addIndexesNoOptimize is confusing - 
especially on when to invoke each. Also, addIndexes calls optimize() in 
the beginning, but only on the target index. It also includes the 
following jdoc statement, which from how I understand the code, is 
wrong: _After this completes, the index is optimized._ -- optimize() is 
called in the beginning and not in the end. 

On the other hand, addIndexesNoOptimize does not call optimize(), and 
relies on the MergeScheduler and MergePolicy to handle the merges. 

After a short discussion about that on the list (Thanks Mike for the 
clarifications!) I understand that there are really two core differences 
between the two: 
* addIndexes supports IndexReader extensions
* addIndexesNoOptimize performs better

This issue proposes the following:
# Clear up the documentation of each, spelling out the pros/cons of 
  calling them clearly in the javadocs.
# Rename addIndexesNoOptimize to addIndexes
# Remove optimize() call from addIndexes(IndexReader...)
# Document that clearly in both, w/ a recommendation to call optimize() 
  before on any of the Directories/Indexes if it's a concern. 

That way, we maintain all the flexibility in the API - 
addIndexes(IndexReader...) allows for using IR extensions, 
addIndexes(Directory...) is considered more efficient, by allowing the 
merges to happen concurrently (depending on MS) and also factors in the 
MP. So unless you have an IR extension, addDirectories is really the one 
you should be using. And you have the freedom to call optimize() before 
each if you care about it, or don't if you don't care. Either way, 
incurring the cost of optimize() is entirely in the user's hands. 

BTW, addIndexes(IndexReader...) does not use neither the MergeScheduler 
nor MergePolicy, but rather call SegmentMerger directly. This might be 
another place for improvement. I'll look into it, and if it's not too 
complicated, I may cover it by this issue as well. If you have any hints 
that can give me a good head start on that, please don't be shy :). "

0,"Add an explicit method to invoke IndexDeletionPolicyToday, if one uses an IDP which holds onto segments, such as SnapshotDeletionPolicy, or any other IDP in the tests, those segments are left in the index even if the IDP no longer references them, until IW.commit() is called (and actually does something). I'd like to add a specific method to IW which will invoke the IDP's logic and get rid of the unused segments w/o forcing the user to call IW.commit(). There are a couple of reasons for that:

* Segments take up sometimes valuable HD space, and the application may wish to reclaim that space immediately. In some scenarios, the index is updated once in several hours (or even days), and waiting until then may not be acceptable.
* I think it's a cleaner solution than waiting for the next commit() to happen. One can still wait for it if one wants, but otherwise it will give you the ability to immediately get rid of those segments.
* TestSnapshotDeletionPolicy includes this code, which only strengthens (IMO) the need for such method:
{code}
// Add one more document to force writer to commit a
// final segment, so deletion policy has a chance to
// delete again:
Document doc = new Document();
doc.add(new Field(""content"", ""aaa"", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.ANALYZED, Field.TermVector.WITH_POSITIONS_OFFSETS));
writer.addDocument(doc);
{code}

If IW had an explicit method, that code would not need to exist there at all ...

Here comes the fun part - naming the baby:
* invokeDeletionPolicy -- describes exactly what is going to happen. However, if the user did not set IDP at all (relying on default, which I think many do), users won't understand what is it.
* deleteUnusedSegments - more user-friendly, assuming users understand what 'segments' are.

BTW, IW already has deleteUnusedFiles() which only tries to delete unreferenced files that failed to delete before (such as on Windows, due to e.g. open readers). Perhaps instead of inventing a new name, we can change IW.deleteUnusedFiles to call IndexFileDeleter.checkpoint (instead of deletePendingFiles) which deletes those files + calls IDP.onCommit()."

0,"Inefficient growth of OpenBitSetHi, I found a potentially serious efficiency problem with OpenBitSet.

One typical (I think) way to build a bit set is to set() the bits one by one -
e.g., have a HitCollector set() the bit for each matching document.
The underlying array of longs needs to grow as more as more bits are set, of
course.

But looking at the code, it appears to me that the array grows very
ineefficiently - in the worst case (when doc ids are sorted, as they would
normally be in the HitCollector case for example), copying the array again
and again for every added bit... The relevant code in OpenBitSet.java is:

  public void set(long index) {
    int wordNum = expandingWordNum(index);
    ...
  }

  protected int expandingWordNum(long index) {
    int wordNum = (int)(index >> 6);
    if (wordNum>=wlen) {
      ensureCapacity(index+1);
    ...
  }
  public void ensureCapacityWords(int numWords) {
    if (bits.length < numWords) {
      long[] newBits = new long[numWords];
      System.arraycopy(bits,0,newBits,0,wlen);
      bits = newBits;
    }
  }

As you can see, if the bits array is not long enough, a new one is
allocated at exactly the right size - and in the worst case it can grow
just one word every time...

Shouldn't the growth be more exponential in nature, e.g., grow to the maximum
of index+1 and twice the existing size?

Alternatively, if the growth is so inefficient, this should be documented,
and it should be recommended to use the variant of the constructor with the
correct initial size (e.g., in the HitCollector case, the number of documents
in the index). and the fastSet() method instead of set().

Thanks,
Nadav.

Specifically, if we know the current bottom ord ""matches"" the current segment, we can skip the value comparison when the ords are the same (ie, return 0) because the ords are exactly comparable.

- A NodeInfo implementation must either return the complete list of PropertyIds or null if it does not want to return the PropertyIds at that time.

0,"Add deleteAllDocuments() method to IndexWriterIdeally, there would be a deleteAllDocuments() or clear() method on the IndexWriter

This method should have the same performance and characteristics as:
* currentWriter.close()
* currentWriter = new IndexWriter(..., create=true,...)

This would greatly optimize a delete all documents case. Using deleteDocuments(new MatchAllDocsQuery()) could be expensive given a large existing index.

IndexWriter.deleteAllDocuments() should have the same semantics as a commit(), as far as index visibility goes (new IndexReader opening would get the empty index)

I see this was previously asked for in LUCENE-932, however it would be nice to finally see this added such that the IndexWriter would not need to be closed to perform the ""clear"" as this seems to be the general recommendation for working with an IndexWriter now

deleteAllDocuments() method should:
* abort any background merges (they are pointless once a deleteAll has been received)
* write new segments file referencing no segments

0,"Move listeners from item state to item state managersClients interested in item state modifications directly subscribe to the item states, which is a very flexible approach.

0,"[PATCH] Decouple locking implementation from Directory implementationThis is a spinoff of http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-305.

I've opened this new issue to capture that it's wider scope than
LUCENE-305.

This is a patch originally created by Jeff Patterson (see above link)
and then modified as described here:

  http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-305#action_12418493

with some small additional changes:

  * For each FSDirectory.getDirectory(), I made a corresponding
    version that also accepts a LockFactory instance.  So, you can
    construct an FSDirectory with your own LockFactory.

  * Cascaded defaulting for FSDirectory's LockFactory implementation:
    if you pass in a LockFactory instance, it's used; else if
    setDisableLocks was called, we use NoLockFactory; else, if the
    system property ""org.apache.lucene.store.FSDirectoryLockFactoryClass""
    is defined, we use that; finally, we'll use the original locking
    implementation (SimpleFSLockFactory).

The gist is that all locking code has been moved out of *Directory and
into subclasses of a new abstract LockFactory class.  You can now set
the LockFactory of a Directory to change how it does locking.  For
example, you can create an FSDirectory but set its locking to
SingleInstanceLockFactory (if you know all writing/reading will take
place a single JVM).

The changes pass all unit tests (on Ubuntu Linux Sun Java 1.5 and
Windows XP Sun Java 1.4), and I added another TestCase to test the
LockFactory code.

Note that LockFactory defaults are not changed: FSDirectory defaults
to SimpleFSLockFactory and RAMDirectory defaults to
SingleInstanceLockFactory.

Next step (separate issue) is to create a LockFactory that uses the OS
native locks (through java.nio).

0,"Remove PropDefId and NodeDefIdthe PropDefIds and NodeDefIds are used to quickly lookup a childnode- or property definition in the nodetype registry (or effective nodetype).
this is heavily used during reading, when calling Property.getDefinition() usually when checking the isMultiple() flag. and of course while writing when getting the definition for the property or childnode. 

however, this poses problems when a nodetype is changed that is still used in the content. if a property definition is changed due to an altered nodetype, subsequent accesses to that property result in a ""invalid propdefid"" warning in the log - but the id is recomputed. this is especially a problem when upgrade jackrabbit from 1.x to 2.0, where some of the builtin nodetypes are defined differently.

i think that it should be feasible to remove the propdefids and nodedefids and compute the definition on demand. i think this can be implemented without performance loss, when some sort of 'signatures' of the items are computed to quickly find the definitions in the effective node type. furthermore, the most common usecase for using the property definition is probably the isMultiple() check - which is now on the Property interface itself - which does not need a definition lookup at all.

0,"TCK vs available property typesThe TCK tests allow configuration of node type / property names to tests specific property types, but they do not take into account that a given repository may not support a specific property type (this is similar to issue JCR-801 about multiple workspace support).

JSR-170 is a bit fuzzy here: it requires all types, but does not require that every type actually exists on a settable node type. In practice, a repository may support reference properties on the builtin nodetypes for version storage, but nowhere else.

Thus, there should be a way to configure the tests so that specific property type tests are left out. Again, there are a few possibilities to do that:

1) reserve a special property name for the case where the test should be skipped (""PROPERTY_TYPE_NOT_SUPPORT""), or

2) add new config flags.

The latter arguably is the cleaner approach, the former avoids introducing new configuration parameters. Thus, I'm leaning to 2). Feedback appreciated.

This problem is actually a bit self-enforcing: if something goes wrong during startup, the code in the shutdown() method that is called is actually very prone to fail as it might not expect such a broken-startup state.

0,"Per thread DocumentsWriters that write their own private segmentsSee LUCENE-2293 for motivation and more details.

I'm copying here Mike's summary he posted on 2293:

Change the approach for how we buffer in RAM to a more isolated
approach, whereby IW has N fully independent RAM segments
in-process and when a doc needs to be indexed it's added to one of
them. Each segment would also write its own doc stores and
""normal"" segment merging (not the inefficient merge we now do on
flush) would merge them. This should be a good simplification in
the chain (eg maybe we can remove the *PerThread classes). The
segments can flush independently, letting us make much better
concurrent use of IO & CPU."

0,"Collapse nested OR expressionsExecuting a query with multiple OR expressions in a predicate leads to score values that depend on the order of the operands.

For example, the following query:

//*[jcr:contains(@prop1, 'foo') or jcr:contains(@prop2, 'foo') or jcr:contains(@prop3, 'foo')] order by @jcr:score descending

will return a slightly different result compared to:

//*[jcr:contains(@prop3, 'foo') or jcr:contains(@prop1, 'foo') or jcr:contains(@prop2, 'foo')] order by @jcr:score descending

Internally jackrabbit parses the predicate of the first query into a tree:

orExpr(orExpr(contains(prop1, 'foo'), contains(prop2, 'foo')), contains(prop3, 'foo'))

Lucene will calculate the score for the inner OR expression first and then for the outer, which is not equivalent with a nested expression that has property names in a different sequence.

The query should be translated internally into a single OR expression with three operands. That way, the score value is always the same, irrespective of the order of the operands."
0,"optional normsFor applications with many indexed fields, the norms cause memory problems both during indexing and querying.
This patch makes norms optional on a per-field basis, in the same way that term vectors are optional per-field.

Overview of changes:
 - Field.omitNorms that defaults to false
 - backward compatible lucene file format change: FieldInfos.FieldBits has a bit for omitNorms
 - IndexReader.hasNorms() method
 - During merging, if any segment includes norms, then norms are included.
 - methods to get norms return the equivalent 1.0f array for backward compatibility

The patch was designed for backward compatibility:
 - all current unit tests pass w/o any modifications required
 - compatible with old indexes since the default is omitNorms=false
 - compatible with older/custom subclasses of IndexReader since a default hasNorms() is provided
 - compatible with older/custom users of IndexReader such as Weight/Scorer/explain since a norm array is produced on demand, even if norms were not stored

If this patch is accepted (or if the direction is acceptable), performance for scoring  could be improved by assuming 1.0f when hasNorms(field)==false.

0,"Document order of result nodes should be configurableQueries without an order by clause are performed with document order for the result nodes. This is a quite expensive operation, because the document order is available in the search index itself. The document order is calculated with the help of the ItemStateManager and requires loading of all result node states including their ancestors.

Queries with a lot of result nodes become quite expensive, even though the actual query execution is fast. Because most use cases will not care for the document order, this feature should be made configurable. Some parameter for the QueryHandler that disables the document order on result nodes."
0,"Index Writer constructor flags unclear - and annoying in certain casesWouldn't it make more sense if the constructor for the IndexWriter always
created an index if it doesn't exist - and the boolean parameter should be
""clear"" (instead of ""create"")

So instead of this (from javadoc):

IndexWriter

public IndexWriter(Directory d,
                   Analyzer a,
                   boolean create)
            throws IOException

    Constructs an IndexWriter for the index in d. Text will be analyzed with a.
If create is true, then a new, empty index will be created in d, replacing the
index already there, if any.

Parameters:
    d - the index directory
    a - the analyzer to use
    create - true to create the index or overwrite the existing one; false to
append to the existing index 
Throws:
    IOException - if the directory cannot be read/written to, or if it does not
exist, and create is false


We would have this:

IndexWriter

public IndexWriter(Directory d,
                   Analyzer a,
                   boolean clear)
            throws IOException

    Constructs an IndexWriter for the index in d. Text will be analyzed with a.
If clear is true, and a index exists at location d, then it will be erased, and
a new, empty index will be created in d.

Parameters:
    d - the index directory
    a - the analyzer to use
    clear - true to overwrite the existing one; false to append to the existing
index 
Throws:
    IOException - if the directory cannot be read/written to, or if it does not
exist.



Its current behavior is kind of annoying, because I have an app that should
never clear an existing index, it should always append.  So I want create set to
false.  But when I am starting a brand new index, then I have to change the
create flag to keep it from throwing an exception...  I guess for now I will
have to write code to check if a index actually has content yet, and if it
doesn't, change the flag on the fly."

0,"Added New Token API impl for ASCIIFoldingFilterI added an implementation of incrementToken to ASCIIFoldingFilter.java and extended the existing  testcase for it.
I will attach the patch shortly.
Beside this improvement I would like to start up a small discussion about this filter. ASCIIFoldingFitler is meant to be a replacement for ISOLatin1AccentFilter which is quite nice as it covers a superset of the latter. I have used this filter quite often but never on a as it is basis. In the most cases this filter does the correct thing (replace a special char with its ascii correspondent) but in some cases like for German umlaut it does not return the expected result. A german umlaut  like 'ä' does not translate to a but rather to 'ae'. I would like to change this but I'n not 100% sure if that is expected by all users of that filter. Another way of doing it would be to make it configurable with a flag. This would not affect performance as we only check if such a umlaut char is found. 
Further it would be really helpful if that filter could ""inject"" the original/unmodified token with the same position increment into the token stream on demand. I think its a valid use-case to index the modified and unmodified token. For instance, the german word ""süd"" would be folded to ""sud"". In a query q:(süd) the filter would also fold to sud and therefore find sud which has a totally different meaning. Folding works quite well but for special cases would could add those options to make users life easier. The latter could be done in a subclass while the umlaut problem should be fixed in the base class.

0,"MergePolicy should require an IndexWriter upon constructionMergePolicy does not require an IW upon construction, but requires one to be passed as method arg to various methods. This gives the impression as if a single MP instance can be shared across various IW instances, which is not true for all MPs (if at all). In addition, LogMergePolicy uses the IW instance passed to these methods incosistently, and is currently exposed to potential NPEs.

This issue will change MP to require an IW instance, however for back-compat reasons the following changes will be made:
# A new MP ctor w/ IW as arg will be introduced. Additionally, for back-compat a default ctor will also be declared which will assign null to the member IW.
# Methods that require IW will be deprecated, and new ones will be declared.
#* For back-compat, the new ones will not be made abstract, but will throw UOE, with a comment that they will become abstract in 3.0.
# All current MP impls will move to use the member instance.
# The code which calls MP methods will continue to use the deprecated methods, passing an IW even that it won't be necessary --> this is strictly for back-compat.

In 3.0, we'll remove the deprecated default ctor and methods, and change the code to not call the IW method variants anymore.

0,"Add AttributeSource.copyTo(AttributeSource)One problem with AttributeSource at the moment is the missing ""insight"" into AttributeSource.State. If you want to create TokenStreams that inspect cpatured states, you have no chance. Making the contents of State public is a bad idea, as it does not help for inspecting (its a linked list, so you have to iterate).

AttributeSource currently contains a cloneAttributes() call, which returns a new AttrubuteSource with all current attributes cloned. This is the (more expensive) captureState. The problem is that you cannot copy back the cloned AS (which is the restoreState). To use this behaviour (by the way, ShingleMatrix can use it), one can alternatively use cloneAttributes and copyTo. You can easily change the cloned attributes and store them in lists and copy them back. The only problem is lower performance of these calls (as State is a very optimized class).

One use case could be:
{code}
AttributeSource state = cloneAttributes();
// .... do something ...
state.getAttribute(TermAttribute.class).setTermBuffer(foobar);

0,"REFERENCE properties produce duplicate strings in memoryWhen reference property is loaded from PM, Serializer.deserialize(NodeReferences, InputStream) is called, which calls PropertyId.valueOf(String), which in turn calls NameFactoryImpl.create(String) which finally splits a full property name to namespace and local name. Namespace is internalized, but local name is not (comments say that this is done to avoid perm space overfilling).
So, in the end, a new String instance is created for local name. This leads to considerable memory waste when repository has a lot of nodes with REFERENCE properties.
It seems that local name part could be internalized here too because in the most repositories it's not allowed to create properties with arbitrary names, so the danger of perm space exhaust does not seem to be an argument.

Hi all,
I am trying to authenticate to a server via a proxy which also requires
authentication. It seems that I can get either the proxy authentication to work
OR the site authentication to work, but not both.

Both seem to work independently when I set the credentials (or proxy
credentials) using NTCredentials (e.g. if I connect to the site from a network
not using a proxy I can get it to work, and I can authenticate to the proxy only
to get a 401 authentication failed from the server when using the proxy).

I read in the Authentication tutorial that you can't authenticate using NTLM to
both the proxy and site, so I'm trying various combinations of authentication,
but I can't find any documentation that specifically covers this case and I feel
like I'm just taking stabs in the dark right now.

If anyone can point me in the direction of the light at the end of the tunnel
I'd really appreciate it.

Thanks,
David

David,

You _really_ can't use NTLM to authenticate with the proxy and the
target host at the same, due to the nature of this authentication
scheme. Really. That was not a joke.

Please consider using one of the following combinations instead:

(1) BASIC proxy + NTLM host if both the clent and the proxy are within a
trusted network segment

(2) NTLM proxy + SSL + BASIC host

Both combinations should provide an adequate (or better in the latter case)
security

Hope this helps

Oleg

-------------------

Thanks for the reply Oleg. This is what I figured, but I cannot see how to use
different authentication schemes for the Proxy vs. the Site authentication
challenge.

I tried adding the code suggested in the Authentication tutorial:

        List authPrefs = new ArrayList(2);
        authPrefs.add(AuthPolicy.DIGEST);
        authPrefs.add(AuthPolicy.BASIC);
        authPrefs.add(AuthPolicy.NTLM);
         This will exclude the NTLM authentication scheme
        httpclient.getParams().setParameter(AuthPolicy.AUTH_SCHEME_PRIORITY,
authPrefs);

I got a message stating that it was attempting BASIC authentication for the
Proxy and that it failed (probably because the domain doesn't get passed I
guess). So my thought is that I need NTLM for the proxy authentication and Basic
will work for the site authentication.

The question I am then working on is how to direct the HttpClient to select that
order of authentication methods. If I let it take NTLM as the preffered
authentication method then it will try to authenticate both challenges with NTLM.

I sure there is just some little detail I'm missing here somewhere, it's just
hard to find it.

Thanks a lot!
David

--------------

Hi Oleg, thanks, I'll put that request in today.
This helps a lot, at least I know I'm on the right path now.

I am attempting to devise a workaround for this by handling the authentication
manually (setDoAuthentication(false)).

When I see a 401 error I am processing a basic authentication with the site
credentials, when I see a 407 error I want to process an NTLM authentication
with the proxy credentials.

To that end I have the following code that runs after
httpclient.execute(getmethod) executes. The code below works perfectly for the
basic authentication (when the proxy is not in the picture).

In looking up the Handshake of the NTLM authentication I see that I have a
problem with the code below since the handshake includes 2 challenge and
authorization steps before the authentication succeeds. I'm not clear how I
could manually authenticate the NTLM response. I would expect the NTLMScheme
class to contain a Type 1 and Type 3 authenticate() method for processing both
challenge responses. Is there another way of processing the NTLM authentication
after receiving the initial authentication challenge from the server?

        //Check for Proxy or Site authentication
        if(getmethod.getStatusCode() == 401){
            //Authenticate to the site using Basic authentication.
            BasicScheme basicscheme = new BasicScheme();
            String basic_auth_string = basicscheme.authenticate(new
NTCredentials(""cwftp"", ""664A754c"", """", """"), getmethod);
            Header basic_auth_header = new Header(""Authorization"",
basic_auth_string);
            getmethod.addRequestHeader(basic_auth_header);
            try{
                httpclient.executeMethod(getmethod);
            }catch(Exception e){
                logger.log(Level.SEVERE, ""ack!!!!"", e);
            }
            return getmethod;
       }else if(getmethod.getStatusCode() == 407){
            //Authenticate to the site using Basic authentication
            NTLMScheme ntlmscheme = new NTLMScheme();
            String basic_auth_string = ntlmscheme.authenticate(new
NTCredentials(""00mercbac"", ""!@SAMmerc2004"", ""simproxy"", ""CFC""), getmethod);
            Header basic_auth_header = new Header(""Authorization"",
basic_auth_string);
            getmethod.addRequestHeader(basic_auth_header);
            try{
                httpclient.executeMethod(getmethod);
            }catch(Exception e){

0,"Improve BufferedIndexInput.readBytes() performanceDuring a profiling session, I discovered that BufferedIndexInput.readBytes(),
the function which reads a bunch of bytes from an index, is very inefficient
in many cases. It is efficient for one or two bytes, and also efficient
for a very large number of bytes (e.g., when the norms are read all at once);
But for anything in between (e.g., 100 bytes), it is a performance disaster.
It can easily be improved, though, and below I include a patch to do that.

The basic problem in the existing code was that if you ask it to read 100
bytes, readBytes() simply calls readByte() 100 times in a loop, which means
we check byte after byte if the buffer has another character, instead of just
checking once how many bytes we have left, and copy them all at once.

My version, attached below, copies these 100 bytes if they are available at
bulk (using System.arraycopy), and if less than 100 are available, whatever
is available gets copied, and then the rest. (as before, when a very large
number of bytes is requested, it is read directly into the final buffer).

In my profiling, this fix caused amazing performance
improvement: previously, BufferedIndexInput.readBytes() took as much as 25%
of the run time, and after the fix, this was down to 1% of the run time! However, my scenario is *not* the typical Lucene code, but rather a version of Lucene with added payloads, and these payloads average at 100 bytes, where the original readBytes() did worst. I expect that my fix will have less of an impact on ""vanilla"" Lucene, but it still can have an impact because it is used for things like reading fields. (I am not aware of a standard Lucene benchmark, so I can't provide benchmarks on a more typical case).

In addition to the change to readBytes(), my attached patch also adds a new
unit test to BufferedIndexInput (which previously did not have a unit test).
This test simulates a ""file"" which contains a predictable series of bytes, and
then tries to read from it with readByte() and readButes() with various
sizes (many thousands of combinations are tried) and see that exactly the
expected bytes are read. This test is independent of my new readBytes()
inplementation, and can be used to check the old implementation as well.

By the way, it's interesting that BufferedIndexOutput.writeBytes was already efficient, and wasn't simply a loop of writeByte(). Only the reading code was inefficient. I wonder why this happened."
0,"LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket() should have access to HttpParamsWe use a custom implementation of LayeredSchemeSocketFactory that manages a keystore location through HttpParams. That allows us to use different keystores on a per connection basis.

When a proxy is used LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket() is invoked which does not have a parameter that passes the HttpParams along. In consequence certificate authentication fails in our implementation. Is there a reason why all other factory methods in the super class have an HttpParams parameter except for LayeredSchemeSocketFactory.createLayeredSocket()?

0,"NetscapeDraftSpec is too strict about cookie expires date formatThe Netscape Draft specification (http://curl.haxx.se/rfc/cookie_spec.html) specifies clearly that the date format for Set-Cookie expires is ""Wdy, DD-Mon-YYYY HH:MM:SS GMT"". But on the other hand, in the examples section of the same document, the only example header that contains ""Expires"" is the following:

Set-Cookie: CUSTOMER=WILE_E_COYOTE; path=/; expires=Wednesday, 09-Nov-99 23:12:40 GMT

Note that the weekday is fully spelled out and that the year is written as two digits only. I would say that the specification therefore makes the 2 or 4 digit year optional. I think NetscapeDraftSpec should reflect this. An example of a product that uses the 2 digit version is jetty 6 and 7. When using httpclient 4 talking to a jetty server, any Set-Cookie headers for persistent cookies will be interpreted as a 4 digit year in the date and the cookie will immediately be disregarded as expired by some 2,000 years or so. Httpclient 3 on the other hand had no problem understanding the persistent cookies from jetty. I filed a bug report https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=304698 on jetty to change their date format, but on the other hand I also think httpclient 4 is too strict about the date format when even the original specification uses two alternatives.

Workaround is easy by setting CookieSpecPNames.DATE_PATTERNS, but I really think that projects like jetty and httpclient should be compatible by default. Also, since the date format used by jetty is parsable but misinterpreted and disregarded by httpclient makes it especially hard to detect the first time on encounters the problem."

0,"Move JCRWebdavServerServlet to jcr-server and make it abstractIn line with isse JCR-417, I suggest to partially move the JCRWebdavServerServlet from the jcr-webapp project to the jcr-server project. By partially I mean, that the new (moved) servlet will be abstract and the getRepository() method will be abstract. The jcr-webapp project will still contain a JCRWebdavServerServlet (for backwards compatibility maintaing the same name) which just extends the new servlet and implements the getRepository() method using the RepositoryAccess servlet.

This allows for the reuse of the jcr-server project including the abstract JCRWebdavServerServlet in other environments.

    Header authenticate(

}

Binary compatibility can be maintained by doing an instanceof check at the location where AuthScheme.authenticate() is called at the moment, and calling the context aware version if available.

This interface is necessary for the NegotiateScheme authentication scheme because the service names for the authentication tickets are based on the hostname of the target host or proxy host, depending on whether it's normal or proxy authentication, and this information is only available from the HttpContext.

Without the HttpContext there is a workaround that works most of the time, which looks like this:

	String host;
	if (isProxy()) {
		// FIXME this should actually taken from the HttpContext.
		HttpHost proxy = ConnRouteParams.getDefaultProxy(request.getParams());
		host = proxy.getHostName();
	} else {
		host = request.getLastHeader(""Host"").getValue();

0,"Performance improvement for TermInfosReaderCurrently we have a bottleneck for multi-term queries: the dictionary lookup is being done
twice for each term. The first time in Similarity.idf(), where searcher.docFreq() is called.
The second time when the posting list is opened (TermDocs or TermPositions).

The dictionary lookup is not cheap, that's why a significant performance improvement is
possible here if we avoid the second lookup. An easy way to do this is to add a small LRU 
cache to TermInfosReader. 

I ran some performance experiments with an LRU cache size of 20, and an mid-size index of
500,000 documents from wikipedia. Here are some test results:

50,000 AND queries with 3 terms each:
old:                  152 secs
new (with LRU cache): 112 secs (26% faster)

50,000 OR queries with 3 terms each:
old:                  175 secs
new (with LRU cache): 133 secs (24% faster)

For bigger indexes this patch will probably have less impact, for smaller once more.

* when analyzers insert artificially constructed tokens into TokenStream (e.g. ASCII-fied versions of accented terms, stemmed terms), and it's unlikely that users submit queries containing both versions of tokens: in this case lengthNorm calculation should ignore the tokens with positionIncrement=0.

* when analyzers insert synonyms, and it's likely that users may submit queries that contain multiple synonymous terms: in this case the lengthNorm should be calculated as it is now, i.e. it should take into account all terms no matter what is their positionIncrement.

The default should be backward-compatible, i.e. it should count all tokens.

the container for free connections behaves as a stack rather than a queue.

JRE bug, as best I can tell.  I'm opening this to gather all things we
know, and to work around it in Lucene if possible, and maybe open an
issue with Sun if we can reduce it to a compact test case.

It's hit at least 3 users:

  http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200803.mbox/%3c8c4e68610803180438x39737565q9f97b4802ed774a5@mail.gmail.com%3e

It's specific to at least JRE 1.6.0_04 and 1.6.0_05, that affects
Lucene.  Whereas 1.6.0_03 works OK and it's unknown whether 1.6.0_06
shows it.

The bug affects bulk merging of stored fields.  When it strikes, the
segment produced by a merge is corrupt because its fdx file (stored
fields index file) is missing one document.  After iterating many
times with the first user that hit this, adding diagnostics &
assertions, its seems that a call to fieldsWriter.addDocument some
either fails to run entirely, or, fails to invoke its call to
indexStream.writeLong.  It's as if when hotspot compiles a method,
there's some sort of race condition in cutting over to the compiled
code whereby a single method call fails to be invoked (speculation).

Unfortunately, this corruption is silent when it occurs and only later
detected when a merge tries to merge the bad segment, or an
IndexReader tries to open it.  Here's a typical merge exception:

I've already added assertions to Lucene to detect when this bug
strikes, but since assertions are not usually enabled, I plan to add a
real check to catch when this bug strikes *before* we commit the merge
to the index.  This way we can detect & quarantine the failure and
prevent corruption from entering the index.

"
0,"Merge UUID to NodeIdThe current NodeId class is mostly just a wrapper around UUID, which causes two objects to be instantiated for each node identifier that the system uses. The memory and processing overhead is quite small, but given that there are tons of NodeId instances it would be good to eliminate that overhead.

There is also lots of code that just converts UUIDs to NodeIds and vice versa. We could simplify such code if we just used NodeId everywhere.

Also, we might want to open up the possibility of using non-UUID node identifiers at some point in future, so it would make a lot of sense to remove the NodeId.getUUID method and rely directly on NodeId and it's equals(), hashCode(), and toString() methods in many places where we currently use UUIDs."
0,"Add a isDeleted method to IndexCommitI wish to add a IndexCommit.isDeleted() method.

The use-case is that Solr will now support configurable IndexDeletionPolicy (SOLR-617). For the new replication (SOLR-561) to work, we need access to a list of IndexCommit instances which haven't been deleted yet. I can wrap the user specified IndexDeletionPolicy but since the IndexCommit does not have a isDeleted method, I may store a reference to an IndexCommit on which delete() has been called by the deletion policy. I can wrap the IndexCommit objects too just for having a isDeleted() method so a workaround exists. Not a big pain but if it can be managed on the lucene side easily, I'll appreciate it. It would save me from writing some delegate code."
0,"All Tokenizer implementations should have constructors that take AttributeSource and AttributeFactoryI have a TokenStream implementation that joins together multiple sub TokenStreams (i then do additional filtering on top of this, so i can't just have the indexer do the merging)

in 2.4, this worked fine.
once one sub stream was exhausted, i just started using the next stream 

however, in 2.9, this is very difficult, and requires copying Term buffers for every token being aggregated

however, if all the sub TokenStreams share the same AttributeSource, and my ""concat"" TokenStream shares the same AttributeSource, this goes back to being very simple (and very efficient)


So for example, i would like to see the following constructor added to StandardTokenizer:
{code}
  public StandardTokenizer(AttributeSource source, Reader input, boolean replaceInvalidAcronym) {
    super(source);

The attached patch removes the unused logger and makes the package independent from lo4j"
0,"Multi-level skipping on posting listsTo accelerate posting list skips (TermDocs.skipTo(int)) Lucene uses skip lists. 
The default skip interval is set to 16. If we want to skip e. g. 100 documents, 
then it is not necessary to read 100 entries from the posting list, but only 
100/16 = 6 skip list entries plus 100%16 = 4 entries from the posting list. This 
speeds up conjunction (AND) and phrase queries significantly.

However, the skip interval is always a compromise. If you have a very big index 
with huge posting lists and you want to skip over lets say 100k documents, then 
it is still necessary to read 100k/16 = 6250 entries from the skip list. For big 
indexes the skip interval could be set to a higher value, but then after a big 
skip a long scan to the target doc might be necessary.

A solution for this compromise is to have multi-level skip lists that guarantee a 
logarithmic amount of skips to any target in the posting list. This patch 
implements such an approach in the following way:

  Example for skipInterval = 3:
                                                      c            (skip level 2)
                  c                 c                 c            (skip level 1) 
      x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x     x      (skip level 0)
  d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d d  (posting list)
      3     6     9     12    15    18    21    24    27    30     (df)
 
  d - document
  x - skip data
  c - skip data with child pointer
 
Skip level i contains every skipInterval-th entry from skip level i-1. Therefore the 
number of entries on level i is: floor(df / ((skipInterval ^ (i + 1))).
 
Each skip entry on a level i>0 contains a pointer to the corresponding skip entry in 
list i-1. This guarantees a logarithmic amount of skips to find the target document.


Implementations details:

   * I factored the skipping code out of SegmentMerger and SegmentTermDocs to 
     simplify those classes. The two new classes AbstractSkipListReader and 
	 AbstractSkipListWriter implement the skipping functionality.
   * While AbstractSkipListReader and Writer take care of writing and reading the 
     multiple skip levels, they do not implement an actual skip data format. The two 
	 new subclasses DefaultSkipListReader and Writer implement the skip data format 
	 that is currently used in Lucene (with two file pointers for the freq and prox 
	 file and with payload length information). I added this extra layer to be 
	 prepared for flexible indexing and different posting list formats. 
      
   
File format changes: 

   * I added the new parameter 'maxSkipLevels' to the term dictionary and increased the
     version of this file. If maxSkipLevels is set to one, then the format of the freq 
	 file does not change at all, because we only have one skip level as before. For 
	 backwards compatibility maxSkipLevels is set to one automatically if an index 
	 without the new parameter is read. 
   * In case maxSkipLevels > 1, then the frq file changes as follows:
     FreqFile (.frq) --> <TermFreqs, SkipData>^TermCount
	 SkipData        --> <<SkipLevelLength, SkipLevel>^(Min(maxSkipLevels, 
	                       floor(log(DocFreq/log(skipInterval))) - 1)>, SkipLevel>
	 SkipLevel       --> <SkipDatum>^DocFreq/(SkipInterval^(Level + 1))

	 Remark: The length of the SkipLevel is not stored for level 0, because 1) it is not 
	 needed, and 2) the format of this file does not change for maxSkipLevels=1 then.
	 
	 
All unit tests pass with this patch."

0,"Single-pass grouping collector based on doc blocksLUCENE-3112 enables adding/updating a contiguous block of documents to

When an app does this, it can enable neat features like LUCENE-2454
(nested documents), post-group facet counting (LUCENE-3097).

It also makes single-pass grouping possible, when you group by
the ""identifier"" field shared by the doc block, since we know we will
see a given group only once with all of its docs within one block.

This should be faster than the fully general two-pass collectors we
already have.

0,"Field Selection and Lazy Field LoadingThe patch to come shortly implements a Field Selection and Lazy Loading mechanism for Document loading on the IndexReader.

It introduces a FieldSelector interface that defines the accept method:
FieldSelectorResult accept(String fieldName);

(Perhaps we want to expand this to take in other parameters such as the field metadata (term vector, etc.))

Anyone can implement a FieldSelector to define how they want to load fields for a Document.  
The FieldSelectorResult can be one of four values: LOAD, LAZY_LOAD, NO_LOAD, LOAD_AND_BREAK.  
The FieldsReader, as it is looping over the FieldsInfo, applies the FieldSelector to determine what should be done with the current field.

I modeled this after the java.io.FileFilter mechanism.  There are two implementations to date: SetBasedFieldSelector and LoadFirstFieldSelector.  The former takes in two sets of field names, one to load immed. and one to load lazily.  The latter returns LOAD_AND_BREAK on the first field encountered.  See TestFieldsReader for examples.

It should support UTF-8 (I borrowed code from Issue 509, thanks!).  See TestFieldsReader for examples

I added an expert method on IndexInput  named skipChars that takes in the number of characters to skip.  This is a compromise on changing the file format of the fields to better support seeking.  It does some of the work of readChars, but not all of it.  It doesn't require buffer storage and it doesn't do the bitwise operations.  It just reads in the appropriate number of bytes and promptly ignores them.  This is useful for skipping non-binary, non-compressed stored fields.

The biggest change is by far the introduction of the Fieldable interface (as per Doug's suggestion from a mailing list email on Lazy Field loading from a while ago).  Field is now a Fieldable.  All uses of Field have been changed to use Fieldable.  FieldsReader.LazyField also implements Fieldable.

Lazy Field loading is now implemented.  It has a major caveat (that is Documented) in that it clones the underlying IndexInput upon lazy access to the Field value.  IT IS UNDEFINED whether a Lazy Field can be loaded after the IndexInput parent has been closed (although, from what I saw, it does work).  I thought about adding a reattach method, but it seems just as easy to reload the document.  See the TestFieldsReader and DocHelper for examples.

I updated a couple of other tests to reflect the new fields that are on the DocHelper document.

All tests pass."

0,"PayloadsThis patch adds the possibility to store arbitrary metadata (payloads) together with each position of a term in its posting lists. A while ago this was discussed on the dev mailing list, where I proposed an initial design. This patch has a much improved design with modifications, that make this new feature easier to use and more efficient.

A payload is an array of bytes that can be stored inline in the ProxFile (.prx). Therefore this patch provides low-level APIs to simply store and retrieve byte arrays in the posting lists in an efficient way. 

API and Usage
------------------------------   
The new class index.Payload is basically just a wrapper around a byte[] array together with int variables for offset and length. So a user does not have to create a byte array for every payload, but can rather allocate one array for all payloads of a document and provide offset and length information. This reduces object allocations on the application side.

In order to store payloads in the posting lists one has to provide a TokenStream or TokenFilter that produces Tokens with payloads. I added the following two methods to the Token class:
  /** Sets this Token's payload. */
  public void setPayload(Payload payload);
  
  /** Returns this Token's payload. */
  public Payload getPayload();

In order to retrieve the data from the index the interface TermPositions now offers two new methods:
  /** Returns the payload length of the current term position.
   *  This is invalid until {@link #nextPosition()} is called for
   *  the first time.
   * 
   * @return length of the current payload in number of bytes
   */
  int getPayloadLength();
  
  /** Returns the payload data of the current term position.
   * This is invalid until {@link #nextPosition()} is called for
   * the first time.
   * This method must not be called more than once after each call
   * of {@link #nextPosition()}. However, payloads are loaded lazily,
   * so if the payload data for the current position is not needed,
   * this method may not be called at all for performance reasons.
   * 
   * @param data the array into which the data of this payload is to be
   *             stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new byte[] array
   *             is allocated for this purpose. 
   * @param offset the offset in the array into which the data of this payload
   *               is to be stored.
   * @return a byte[] array containing the data of this payload
   * @throws IOException
   */
  byte[] getPayload(byte[] data, int offset) throws IOException;

Furthermore, this patch indroduces the new method IndexOutput.writeBytes(byte[] b, int offset, int length). So far there was only a writeBytes()-method without an offset argument. 

Implementation details
------------------------------
- One field bit in FieldInfos is used to indicate if payloads are enabled for a field. The user does not have to enable payloads for a field, this is done automatically:
   * The DocumentWriter enables payloads for a field, if one ore more Tokens carry payloads.
   * The SegmentMerger enables payloads for a field during a merge, if payloads are enabled for that field in one or more segments.
- Backwards compatible: If payloads are not used, then the formats of the ProxFile and FreqFile don't change
- Payloads are stored inline in the posting list of a term in the ProxFile. A payload of a term occurrence is stored right after its PositionDelta.
- Same-length compression: If payloads are enabled for a field, then the PositionDelta is shifted one bit. The lowest bit is used to indicate whether the length of the following payload is stored explicitly. If not, i. e. the bit is false, then the payload has the same length as the payload of the previous term occurrence.
- In order to support skipping on the ProxFile the length of the payload at every skip point has to be known. Therefore the payload length is also stored in the skip list located in the FreqFile. Here the same-length compression is also used: The lowest bit of DocSkip is used to indicate if the payload length is stored for a SkipDatum or if the length is the same as in the last SkipDatum.
- Payloads are loaded lazily. When a user calls TermPositions.nextPosition() then only the position and the payload length is loaded from the ProxFile. If the user calls getPayload() then the payload is actually loaded. If getPayload() is not called before nextPosition() is called again, then the payload data is just skipped.
  
Changes of file formats
------------------------------
- FieldInfos (.fnm)
The format of the .fnm file does not change. The only change is the use of the sixth lowest-order bit (0x20) of the FieldBits. If this bit is set, then payloads are enabled for the corresponding field. 

- ProxFile (.prx)
ProxFile (.prx) -->  <TermPositions>^TermCount
TermPositions   --> <Positions>^DocFreq
Positions       --> <PositionDelta, Payload?>^Freq
Payload         --> <PayloadLength?, PayloadData>
PositionDelta   --> VInt
PayloadLength   --> VInt 
PayloadData     --> byte^PayloadLength

For payloads disabled (unchanged):
PositionDelta is the difference between the position of the current occurrence in the document and the previous occurrence (or zero, if this is the first   occurrence in this document).
  
For Payloads enabled:
PositionDelta/2 is the difference between the position of the current occurrence in the document and the previous occurrence. If PositionDelta is odd, then PayloadLength is stored. If PositionDelta is even, then the length of the current payload equals the length of the previous payload and thus PayloadLength is omitted.

- FreqFile (.frq)

SkipDatum     --> DocSkip, PayloadLength?, FreqSkip, ProxSkip
PayloadLength --> VInt

For payloads disabled (unchanged):
DocSkip records the document number before every SkipInterval th document in TermFreqs. Document numbers are represented as differences from the previous value in the sequence.

For payloads enabled:
DocSkip/2 records the document number before every SkipInterval th  document in TermFreqs. If DocSkip is odd, then PayloadLength follows. If DocSkip is even, then the length of the payload at the current skip point equals the length of the payload at the last skip point and thus PayloadLength is omitted.


This encoding is space efficient for different use cases:
   * If only some fields of an index have payloads, then there's no space overhead for the fields with payloads disabled.
   * If the payloads of consecutive term positions have the same length, then the length only has to be stored once for every term. This should be a common case, because users probably use the same format for all payloads.
   * If only a few terms of a field have payloads, then we don't waste much space because we benefit again from the same-length-compression since we only have to store the length zero for the empty payloads once per term.

0,"Optimize refresh operations With the current implementation (recursive) refresh operations cause a full traversal of the sub-tree rooted at the item causing the refresh. This is potentially expensive. 

Instead of invalidating each item in the respective sub-tree I propose to mark the root of the sub-tree as invalidated. Such a mark would include a time stamp. Also individual items would be time stamped with their resolution time. When an item is accessed, it would check if its resolution time stamp is older than the latest invalidation time stamp. If so, it checks whether the invalidation applies to it at all (by traversing up the path) and if so it would re-resolve itself. In any case its resolution time stamp will be updated.

This approach would make invalidation much cheaper without putting much additional load to simple item access. Moreover most of the additional load (traversing up the path) only applies when an invalidation is pending."

Digging into the test, i've found numerous things that are very scary...
* instead of using assertions to test that tokens streams match, it throws an IllegalStateExceptions when they don't, and then logs a bunch of info about the token streams to System.out -- having assertion messages that tell you *exactly* what doens't match would make a lot more sense.
* it builds up a list of files to analyze using patsh thta it evaluates relative to the current working directory -- which means you get different files depending on wether you run the tests fro mthe contrib level, or from the top level build file
* the list of files it looks for include: ""../../*.txt"", ""../../*.html"", ""../../*.xml"" ... so not only do you get different results when you run the tests in the contrib vs at the top level, but different people runing the tests via the top level build file will get different results depending on what types of text, html, and xml files they happen to have two directories above where they checked out lucene.
* the test comments indicates that it's purpose is to show that PatternAnalyzer produces the same tokens as other analyzers - but points out this will fail for WhitespaceAnalyzer because of the 255 character token limit WhitespaceTokenizer imposes -- the test then proceeds to compare PaternAnalyzer to WhitespaceTokenizer, garunteeing a test failure for anyone who happens to have a text file containing more then 255 characters of non-whitespace in a row somewhere in ""../../"" (in my case: my bookmarks.html file, and the hex encoded favicon.gif images)

This issue can be used to collect design proposals and track progress.

1) DAV:resource-id live property

This can be implemented in terms of the JCR UUID. However, we need to turn this one into a URI for WebDAV. If the JCR UUID happens to *really* use UUID syntax, we *could* use urn:uuid. Otherwise, it would probably useful to mint an HTTP URI, served by the WebDAV servlet. (note that the latter has the disadvantage that moving a node to a different server will affect its resource-id, in case that other server allows importing UUIDs).

2) REBIND and UNBIND methods

Same as MOVE and DELETE, with the excpetion of marshalling.

3) DAV:parent-set property

Either trivial (when node isn't shared), or needs to use the JCR 2.0 shared set functionality.

4) BIND method

Either trivial (when shareable nodes aren't supported), or needs to use the JCR 2.0 shared set functionality.

5) Cycle detection in depth:infinity requests

0,"add getFinalOffset() to TokenStreamIf you add multiple Fieldable instances for the same field name to a document, and you then index those fields with TermVectors storing offsets, it's very likely the offsets for all but the first field instance will be wrong.

This is because IndexWriter under the hood adds a cumulative base to the offsets of each field instance, where that base is 1 + the endOffset of the last token it saw when analyzing that field.

But this logic is overly simplistic.  For example, if the WhitespaceAnalyzer is being used, and the text being analyzed ended in 3 whitespace characters, then that information is lost and then next field's offsets are then all 3 too small.  Similarly, if a StopFilter appears in the chain, and the last N tokens were stop words, then the base will be 1 + the endOffset of the last non-stopword token.

To fix this, I'd like to add a new getFinalOffset() to TokenStream.  I'm thinking by default it returns -1, which means ""I don't know so you figure it out"", meaning we fallback to the faulty logic we have today.

0,"HTTPClient per default relentlessly spams to stderrHTTPClient relentlessly spams to stderr when including it into a project via maven. This is not a decent default behaviour for a libary. Libaries should, per default, communicate their internal state solely and adequatly via their API and let it be up to the application to react to that state (logging it is one such reaction). From some replies to tickets in the same vain I can see that this is perhaps a sensitive topic as some see logging to be a core concern of HTTPClient. I do agree it's helpful as a debugging tool but as such it needs to be opt-in. As a standard error output, the logging of HTTPClient is absolutely useless because it does not and can not describe what the application is trying to do.

Why this improvement when there is a way to disable HTTClient logging (in fact, there seem to be many ways ... always a bad sign ..)?

Do a google search for: httpclient ""console spam""
204 hit for this harsh phrasing alone. Search this phrase for any other libary you like to use and compare the number of hits. Ask youself, how often have you seen the java standard libary write to stdout or stderr?

Personally, I tried to disable it via JDK14 getLogger(""org.apache"").setLevel(Level.OFF)  which wouldn't work and now am using a solution I found on Stackoverflow which is:

System.setProperty(""org.apache.commons.logging.Log"", ""org.apache.commons.logging.impl.NoOpLog""); }

The problem I have is that I include this lib and suddently my console is useless because httpclient is all over it (writing a system monitor ...). I have to search google to find a solution (http://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/logging.html does not tell you how to turn logging off ...) and the logical one ""turn of the JDK logger"" does not work right away.

It's really a matter of following the principal of least suprise (a libary is not expected to write to the console which is the observable default behaviour of HTTPClient) and the principal of separation of concerns (logging is a concern for applications and not for libaries).

Following at least one of these would substantially increase the joy of working with the HTTPClient libary.

0,"Add a waitForMerges() method to IndexWriterIt would be very useful to have a waitForMerges() method on the IndexWriter.

Right now, the only way i can see to achieve this is to call IndexWriter.close()

ideally, there would be a method on the IndexWriter to wait for merges without actually closing the index.
This would make it so that background merges (or optimize) can be waited for without closing the IndexWriter, and then reopening a new IndexWriter

the close() reopen IndexWriter method can be problematic if the close() fails as the write lock won't be released
this could then result in the following sequence:
* close() - fails
* force unlock the write lock (per close() documentation)
* new IndexWriter() (acquires write lock)
* finalize() on old IndexWriter releases the write lock
* Index is now not locked, and another IndexWriter pointing to the same directory could be opened

If you don't force unlock the write lock, opening a new IndexWriter will fail until garbage collection calls finalize() the old IndexWriter

If the waitForMerges() method is available, i would likely never need to close() the IndexWriter until right before the process being shutdown, so this issue would not occur (worst case scenario, the waitForMerges() fails)

The approach is similar to LUCENE-2454, in that the app must index

the parent doc at the end of the block, except that this impl is one
pass.

Once you join at indexing time, you can take any query that matches
child docs and join it up to the parent docID space, using
BlockJoinQuery.  You then use BlockJoinCollector, which sorts parent
docs by provided Sort, to gather results, grouped by parent; this
collector finds any BlockJoinQuerys (using Scorer.visitScorers) and
retains the child docs corresponding to each collected parent doc.

After searching is done, you retrieve the TopGroups from a provided
BlockJoinQuery.

Like LUCENE-2454, this is less general than the arbitrary joins in
Solr (SOLR-2272) or parent/child from ElasticSearch

Those field number conflicts will remain until those segments are merged and we stabilize again based on the IW global field numbers. Yet, we unnecessarily creating a BiMap here where we actually should enforce read-only semantics since nobody should modify this FieldInfos instance we loaded from the directory.

0,"Add unsigned packed int impls in oal.utilThere are various places in Lucene that could take advantage of an
efficient packed unsigned int/long impl.  EG the terms dict index in
the standard codec in LUCENE-1458 could subsantially reduce it's RAM
usage.  FieldCache.StringIndex could as well.  And I think ""load into
RAM"" codecs like the one in TestExternalCodecs could use this too.

I'm picturing something very basic like:
{code}
interface PackedUnsignedLongs  {
  long get(long index);
  void set(long index, long value);
}
{code}

Plus maybe an iterator for getting and maybe also for setting.  If it
helps, most of the usages of this inside Lucene will be ""write once""
so eg the set could make that an assumption/requirement.

And a factory somewhere:

{code}
  PackedUnsignedLongs create(int count, long maxValue);
{code}

I think we should simply autogen the code (we can start from the
autogen code in LUCENE-1410), or, if there is an good existing impl
that has a compatible license that'd be great.

I don't have time near-term to do this... so if anyone has the itch,

0,"Performance improvement for merging stored, compressed fieldsHello everyone,

currently the merging of stored, compressed fields is not optimal for the following reason: every time a stored, compressed field is being merged, the FieldsReader uncompresses the data, hence the FieldsWriter has to compress it again when it writes the merged fields data (.fdt) file. The uncompress/compress step is unneccessary and slows down the merge performance significantly.

This patch improves the merge performance by avoiding the uncompress/compress step. In the following I give an overview of the changes I made:
   * Added a new FieldSelectorResult constant named ""LOAD_FOR_MERGE"" to org.apache.lucene.document.FieldSelectorResult
   * SegmentMerger now uses an FieldSelector to get stored fields from the FieldsReader. This FieldSelector's accept() method returns the FieldSelectorResult ""LOAD_FOR_MERGE"" for every field.
   * Added a new inner class to FieldsReader named ""FieldForMerge"", which extends  org.apache.lucene.document.AbstractField. This class holds the field properties and its data. If a field has the FieldSelectorResult ""LOAD_FOR_MERGE"", then the FieldsReader creates an instance of ""FieldForMerge"" and does not uncompress the field's data.
   * FieldsWriter checks if the field it is about to write is an instanceof FieldsReader.FieldForMerge. If true, then it does not compress the field data.


To test the performance I index about 350,000 text files and store the raw text in a stored, compressed field in the lucene index. I use a merge factor of 10. The final index has a size of 366MB. After building the index, I optimize it to measure the pure merge performance.

Here are the performance results:

old version:
   * Time for Indexing:  36.7 minutes
   * Time for Optimizing: 4.6 minutes

patched version:
   * Time for Indexing:  20.8 minutes
   * Time for Optimizing: 0.5 minutes

The results show that the index build time improved by about 43%, and the optimizing step is more than 8x faster. 

A diff of the final indexes (old and patched version) shows, that they are identical. Furthermore, all junit testcases succeeded with the patched version. 

Regards,
  Michael Busch"

0,"Avoid INFINITE RECURSION when Object Model has cycles.The default ObjectConverterImpl is restricted to acyclic graphs in the object model.

Many Java object models are NOT acyclic.   For instance, I am on your Friends list.   Yoar are on my Friends list.     Java encourages such structures.   Almost any large object model in Java will have hidden cycles.

Saving an Object Model that contains cycles using Graffito causes an infinite recursion.

Clearly, it is important to maintain a 1-to-1 correspondence between Nodes and Objects to prevent this.   In the absence of Multiple Parent Nodes, it will be necessary to use REFERENCE or UNDEFINED Items in place of the 2nd (or greater) Node representing a given Object.   My preference si that the default ObjectConverterImpl should support REFERENCE.,    Failing this, use of UNDEFINED also solves this problem and would  acceptable (as default).  Whether or not REFERENCE is used, both insertion and retrieval must provide a reasonable result.   A custom ojbect converter should be available to switch UNDEFINED to REFERENCE, or vice versa.

Also, it is probably best to keep the targeted, well-defined Nodes close to the Root Node.    This implies that the default ObjectConverterImpl should implement a Breadth-First, rather than a Depth-First, traversal of the Object Model on both insertion and retrieval.   Again, if the default is Depth-First, a custom object converter should be available that implements Breadth-First.

Admittedly, support for (2 representations) X (2 traversals) implies a drastic refactoring and/or rewriting of the ObjectConverterImpl class."

0,"Add QueryParser.newFieldQueryNote: this patch changes no behavior, just makes QP more subclassable.

Currently we have Query getFieldQuery(String field, String queryText, boolean quoted)
This contains very hairy methods for producing a query from QP's analyzer.

I propose we factor this into newFieldQuery(Analyzer analyzer, String field, String queryText, boolean quoted)
Then getFieldQuery just calls newFieldQuery(this.analyzer, field, queryText, quoted);

The reasoning is: it can be quite useful to consider the double quote as more than phrases, but a ""more exact"" search.
In the case the user quoted the terms, you might want to analyze the text with an alternate analyzer that:
doesn't produce synonyms, doesnt decompose compounds, doesn't use WordDelimiterFilter 
(you would need to be using preserveOriginal=true at index time for the WDF one), etc etc.

This is similar to the way google's double quote operator works, its not defined as phrase but ""this exact wording or phrase"".
For example compare results to a query of tests versus ""tests"".

Currently you can do this without heavy code duplication, but really only if you make a separate field (which is wasteful),
and make your custom QP lie about its field... in the examples I listed above you can do this with a single field, yet still
have a more exact phrase search.

0,"Add utitily class to manage NRT reopeningI created a simple class, NRTManager, that tries to abstract away some
of the reopen logic when using NRT readers.

You give it your IW, tell it min and max nanoseconds staleness you can
tolerate, and it privately runs a reopen thread to periodically reopen
the searcher.

It subsumes the SearcherManager from LIA2.  Besides running the reopen
thread, it also adds the notion of a ""generation"" containing changes
you've made.  So eg it has addDocument, returning a long.  You can
then take that long value and pass it back to the getSearcher method
and getSearcher will return a searcher that reflects the changes made
in that generation.

This gives your app the freedom to force ""immediate"" consistency (ie
wait for the reopen) only for those searches that require it, like a
verifier that adds a doc and then immediately searches for it, but
also use ""eventual consistency"" for other searches.

I want to also add support for the new ""applyDeletions"" option when
pulling an NRT reader.

Also, this is very new and I'm sure buggy -- the concurrency is either
wrong over overly-locking.  But it's a start...

0,"Directory createOutput and openInput should take an IOContextToday for merging we pass down a larger readBufferSize than for searching because we get better performance.

I think we should generalize this to a class (IOContext), which would hold the buffer size, but then could hold other flags like DIRECT (bypass OS's buffer cache), SEQUENTIAL, etc.

Then, we can make the DirectIOLinuxDirectory fully usable because we would only use DIRECT/SEQUENTIAL during merging.

This will require fixing how IW pools readers, so that a reader opened for merging is not then used for searching, and vice/versa.  Really, it's only all the open file handles that need to be different -- we could in theory share del docs, norms, etc, if that were somehow possible."

0,"Optimize concurrent queriesThere are a number of bottlenecks that prevent scalability of concurrent queries:

- Fake norms are created repeatedly because a new SearchIndex$CombinedIndexReader is created for each query. This prevents caching of fake norms on the level of the CombinedIndexReader. Creating fake norms for index readers that span multiple sub reader is inefficient and should be avoided. Like with other Jackrabbit specific queries, there should be one for TermQuery, which is aware of sub readers. Its weight should then create one scorer for each sub reader. This effectively reuses the fake norms on the sub reader.

- There should be a  UUID cache that maps document number to UUID. This is basically the inverse of the existing DocNumberCache. UUID lookup is regularly a bottleneck in the SegmentReader where the method document() is synchronized and does I/O.

- Queries often contain constraints that limit the result to nodes with a certain flag set to a literal. These constraints should be cached in the query handler."

0,"Supporting deleteDocuments in IndexWriter (Code and Performance Results Provided)Today, applications have to open/close an IndexWriter and open/close an
IndexReader directly or indirectly (via IndexModifier) in order to handle a
mix of inserts and deletes. This performs well when inserts and deletes
come in fairly large batches. However, the performance can degrade
dramatically when inserts and deletes are interleaved in small batches.
This is because the ramDirectory is flushed to disk whenever an IndexWriter
is closed, causing a lot of small segments to be created on disk, which
eventually need to be merged.

We would like to propose a small API change to eliminate this problem. We
are aware that this kind change has come up in discusions before. See
http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-dev/23049?search_string=indexwriter%20delete;#23049
. The difference this time is that we have implemented the change and
tested its performance, as described below.

API Changes
-----------
We propose adding a ""deleteDocuments(Term term)"" method to IndexWriter.
Using this method, inserts and deletes can be interleaved using the same
IndexWriter.

Note that, with this change it would be very easy to add another method to
IndexWriter for updating documents, allowing applications to avoid a
separate delete and insert to update a document.

Also note that this change can co-exist with the existing APIs for deleting
documents using an IndexReader. But if our proposal is accepted, we think
those APIs should probably be deprecated.

Coding Changes
--------------
Coding changes are localized to IndexWriter. Internally, the new
deleteDocuments() method works by buffering the terms to be deleted.
Deletes are deferred until the ramDirectory is flushed to disk, either
because it becomes full or because the IndexWriter is closed. Using Java
synchronization, care is taken to ensure that an interleaved sequence of
inserts and deletes for the same document are properly serialized.

We have attached a modified version of IndexWriter in Release 1.9.1 with
these changes. Only a few hundred lines of coding changes are needed. All
changes are commented by ""CHANGE"". We have also attached a modified version
of an example from Chapter 2.2 of Lucene in Action.

Performance Results
-------------------
To test the performance our proposed changes, we ran some experiments using
the TREC WT 10G dataset. The experiments were run on a dual 2.4 Ghz Intel
Xeon server running Linux. The disk storage was configured as RAID0 array
with 5 drives. Before indexes were built, the input documents were parsed
to remove the HTML from them (i.e., only the text was indexed). This was
done to minimize the impact of parsing on performance. A simple
WhitespaceAnalyzer was used during index build.

We experimented with three workloads:
  - Insert only. 1.6M documents were inserted and the final
    index size was 2.3GB.
  - Insert/delete (big batches). The same documents were
    inserted, but 25% were deleted. 1000 documents were
    deleted for every 4000 inserted.
  - Insert/delete (small batches). In this case, 5 documents
    were deleted for every 20 inserted.

                                current       current          new

Insert/delete (small batches)     --          338 min        134 min

As the experiments show, with the proposed changes, the performance
improved by 60% when inserts and deletes were interleaved in small batches.

0,"isValid should be invoked after analyze rather than before it so it can validate the output of analyzeThe Synonym map has a protected method String analyze(String word) designed for custom stemming.

However, before analyze is invoked on a word, boolean isValid(String str) is used to validate the word - which causes the program to discard words that maybe useable by the custom analyze method. 

I think that isValid should be invoked after analyze rather than before it so it can validate the output of analyze and allow implemters to decide what is valid for the overridden analyze method. (In fact, if you look at code snippet below, isValid should really go after the empty string check)

0,"First cut at column-stride fields (index values storage)I created an initial basic impl for storing ""index values"" (ie
column-stride value storage).  This is still a work in progress... but
the approach looks compelling.  I'm posting my current status/patch
here to get feedback/iterate, etc.

The code is standalone now, and lives under new package
oal.index.values (plus some util changes, refactorings) -- I have yet
to integrate into Lucene so eg you can mark that a given Field's value
should be stored into the index values, sorting will use these values
instead of field cache, etc.

It handles 3 types of values:

  * Six variants of byte[] per doc, all combinations of fixed vs
    variable length, and stored either ""straight"" (good for eg a
    ""title"" field), ""deref"" (good when many docs share the same value,
    but you won't do any sorting) or ""sorted"".

  * Integers (variable bit precision used as necessary, ie this can
    store byte/short/int/long, and all precisions in between)

  * Floats (4 or 8 byte precision)

String fields are stored as the UTF8 byte[].  This patch adds a
BytesRef, which does the same thing as flex's TermRef (we should merge
them).

This patch also adds basic initial impl of PackedInts (LUCENE-1990);
we can swap that out if/when we get a better impl.

This storage is dense (like field cache), so it's appropriate when the
field occurs in all/most docs.  It's just like field cache, except the
reading API is a get() method invocation, per document.

Next step is to do basic integration with Lucene, and then compare
sort performance of this vs field cache.

For the ""sort by String value"" case, I think RAM usage & GC load of
this index values API should be much better than field caache, since
it does not create object per document (instead shares big long[] and
byte[] across all docs), and because the values are stored in RAM as
their UTF8 bytes.

There are abstract Writer/Reader classes.  The current reader impls
are entirely RAM resident (like field cache), but the API is (I think)
agnostic, ie, one could make an MMAP impl instead.

I think this is the first baby step towards LUCENE-1231.  Ie, it
cannot yet update values, and the reading API is fully random-access
by docID (like field cache), not like a posting list, though I
do think we should add an iterator() api (to return flex's DocsEnum)
-- eg I think this would be a good way to track avg doc/field length
for BM25/lnu.ltc scoring.

introduce a method ChildInfo[] NodeInfo.getChildInfos(). The method either returns:

- all child infos, which also gives the correct number of child nodes. this may also mean that an empty array is returned to indicate there are no child nodes.
- null, to indicate that there are *lots* of child nodes and the method RepositoryService.getChildInfos() with the iterator should be used.

0,"Fine grained locking in SharedItemStateManagerThe SharedItemStateManager (SISM) currently uses a simple read-write lock to ensure data consistency. Store operations to the PersistenceManager (PM) are effectively serialized.

We should think about more sophisticated locking to allow concurrent writes on the PM.

One possible approach:

If a transaction is currently storing data in a PM a second transaction may check if the set of changes does not intersect with the first transaction. If that is the case it can safely store its data in the PM.

This fine grained locking must also be respected when reading from the SISM. A read request for an item that is currently being stored must be blocked until the store is finished."

0,"bulk postings should be codec privateIn LUCENE-2723, a lot of work was done to speed up Lucene's bulk postings read API.

There were some upsides:
* you could specify things like 'i dont care about frequency data up front'.
  This made things like multitermquery->filter and other consumers that don't
  care about freqs faster. But this is unrelated to 'bulkness' and we have a
  separate patch now for this on LUCENE-2929.
* the buffersize for standardcodec was increased to 128, increasing performance
  for TermQueries, but this was unrelated too.

But there were serious downsides/nocommits:
* the API was hairy because it tried to be 'one-size-fits-all'. This made consumer code crazy.
* the API could not really be specialized to your codec: e.g. could never take advantage that e.g. docs and freqs are aligned.
* the API forced codecs to implement delta encoding for things like documents and positions. 
  But this is totally up to the codec how it wants to encode! Some codecs might not use delta encoding.
* using such an API for positions was only theoretical, it would have been super complicated and I doubt ever
  performant or maintainable.
* there was a regression with advance(), probably because the api forced you to do both a linear scan thru
  the remaining buffer, then refill...

I think a cleaner approach is to let codecs do whatever they want to implement the DISI
contract. This lets codecs have the freedom to implement whatever compression/buffering they want
for the best performance, and keeps consumers simple. If a codec uses delta encoding, or if it wants
to defer this to the last possible minute or do it at decode time, thats its own business. Maybe a codec
doesn't want to do any buffering at all.

0,"Absorb NIOFSDirectory into FSDirectoryI think whether one uses java.io.* vs java.nio.* or eventually
java.nio2.*, or some other means, is an under-the-hood implementation
detail of FSDirectory and doesn't merit a whole separate class.

I think FSDirectory should be the core class one uses when one's index
is in the filesystem.

So, I'd like to deprecate NIOFSDirectory, absorbing it into
FSDirectory, and add a setting ""useNIO"" to FSDirectory.  It should
default to ""true"" for non-Windows OSs, because it gives far better
concurrent performance on all platforms but Windows (due to known Sun

0,"Try harder to prevent SIGSEGV on cloned MMapIndexInputsWe are unmapping mmapped byte buffers which is disallowed by the JDK, because it has the risk of SIGSEGV when you access the mapped byte buffer after unmapping.

We currently prevent this for the main IndexInput by setting its buffer to null, so we NPE if somebody tries to access the underlying buffer. I recently fixed also the stupid curBuf (LUCENE-3200) by setting to null.

The big problem are cloned IndexInputs which are generally not closed. Those still contain references to the unmapped ByteBuffer, which lead to SIGSEGV easily. The patch from Mike in LUCENE-3439 prevents most of this in Lucene 3.5, but its still not 100% safe (as it uses non-volatiles).

This patch will fix the remaining issues by also setting the buffers of clones to null when the original is closed. The trick is to record weak references of all clones created and close them together with the original. This uses a ConcurrentHashMap<WeakReference<MMapIndexInput>,?> as store with the logic borrowed from WeakHashMap to cleanup the GCed references (using ReferenceQueue).

0,"java.util.logging configuration examples does not work as intendedjava.util.logging configuration examples do not work as intended. Those can be found here: http://jakarta.apache.org/httpcomponents/httpclient-3.x/logging.html

Steps to reproduce:
1. Create a simple project using HttpClient (see listing below) and JDK 1.6 (I suppose it is JDK 1.4 or higher, but I did not test anything other than 1.6). Without log4j in the classpath and without any commons-logging system properties set, java.util.logging is automatically selected by commons-logging.

Expected results:
Quite a few log messages should be sent to System.err

Actual results:
Unless there is an I/O error encountered, no log messages are sent to System.err

The problem, as far as I can see, is caused by the default logging level of java.util.logging.ConsoleHandler, which is set to INFO. In order for any log messages to go through, the log hadler log level needs to be lower than logged messages log level. Adding the following line to all java.util.logging examples should fix the problem:

0,"Move 'good' contrib/queries classes to Queries moduleWith the Queries module now filled with the FunctionQuery stuff, we should look at closing down contrib/queries.  While not a huge contrib, it contains a number of pretty useful classes and some that should go elsewhere.

Heres my proposed plan:

- similar.* -> suggest module
- regex.* -> queries module
- BooleanFilter -> queries module under .filters package
- BoostingQuery -> queries module
- ChainedFilter -> queries module under .filters package
- DuplicateFilter -> queries module under .filters package
- FieldCacheRewriteMethod -> This doesn't belong in this contrib or the queries module.  I think we should push it to contrib/misc for the time being.  It seems to have quite a few constraints on when its useful.  If indeed CONSTANT_SCORE_AUTO rewrite is better, then I dont see a purpose for it.
- FilterClause -> class inside BooleanFilter
- FuzzyLikeThisQuery -> suggest module. This class seems a mess with its Similarity hardcoded.  With all that said, it does seem to do what it claims and with some cleanup, it could be good.
- TermsFilter -> queries module under .filters package
- SlowCollated* -> They can stay in the module till we have a better place to nuke them.

One of the implications of the above moves, is that the xml-query-parser, which supports many of the queries, will need to have a dependency on the queries module.  But that seems unavoidable at this stage.

getVersionHistroy throws a UnsupportedRepositoryException if the node is non-versionable, leading to a DavException further up the call stack.

as a consequence, every request for a non-versionable node leads to unnecessary (and expensive) exception generation which could be avoided by checking the mix:versionable status of a node.

0,"JackrabbitParser and tika 0.7 parserHi,

I was trying to implement a custom parser and found the following problem.
Since tika 0.7 it is possible to implement your custom parser and specify it into a service provider configuration file (META-INF/services/org.apache.tika.parser.Parser). In this way there would be no need to maintain a custom tika-config.xml file if you'd like to implement a custom parser.

The problem that I had was in the JackrabbitParser because I wasn't able to instantiate the AutoDetectParser with the default constructor is will be instantiated using the default TikaConfig constructor.
Basically from tika 0.7, the TikaConfig.getTikaConfig() is instantiating the TikaConfig using the default constructor instead of accessing the tika-config.xml file from withing the package, and reads the service provider configuration files and populate the parsers map.

What I'm proposing is to change the JackrabbitParser to instantiate the AutoDetectParser using the default constructor, in this way the using tika version >= 0.7 we could easily implement our own parsers and there won't be a reason to maintain the tika-config.xml, also a sort of ""backward"" compatibility would be maintained because using the AutoDetectParser default constructor the TikaConfig is instantiated using TikaConfig.getTikaConfig() wich for tika versions < 0.7 calls the TikaConfig(InputStream) constructor whcih reads the configuration directly from the package.

Basically the JackrabbitParser should look like this:

    public JackrabbitParser() {
            	parser = new AutoDetectParser();
    }

using the FieldCache, because MultiTermQuery's getEnum no longer takes IndexReader but Terms, and all the 
FilteredTermsEnums are now just real TermsEnum decorators.

In cases like low frequency queries this is actually slower (I think this has been shown for numeric ranges before too),
but for the really high-frequency cases like especially ugly wildcards, regexes, fuzzies, etc, this can be several times faster 
using the FieldCache instead, since all the terms are in RAM and automaton can blast through them quicker.

0,"Improve indexing performance by increasing internal buffer sizesIn working on LUCENE-843, I noticed that two buffer sizes have a
substantial impact on overall indexing performance.

First is BufferedIndexOutput.BUFFER_SIZE (also used by
BufferedIndexInput).  Second is CompoundFileWriter's buffer used to
actually build the compound file.  Both are now 1 KB (1024 bytes).

I ran the same indexing test I'm using for LUCENE-843.  I'm indexing
~5,500 byte plain text docs derived from the Europarl corpus
(English).  I index 200,000 docs with compound file enabled and term
vector positions & offsets stored plus stored fields.  I flush
documents at 16 MB RAM usage, and I set maxBufferedDocs carefully to
not hit LUCENE-845.  The resulting index is 1.7 GB.  The index is not
optimized in the end and I left mergeFactor @ 10.

I ran the tests on a quad-core OS X 10 machine with 4-drive RAID 0 IO
system.

At 1 KB (current Lucene trunk) it takes 622 sec to build the index; if
I increase both buffers to 8 KB it takes 554 sec to build the index,
which is an 11% overall gain!

I will run more tests to see if there is a natural knee in the curve
(buffer size above which we don't really gain much more performance).

I'm guessing we should leave BufferedIndexInput's default BUFFER_SIZE
at 1024, at least for now.  During searching there can be quite a few
of this class instantiated, and likely a larger buffer size for the
freq/prox streams could actually hurt search performance for those
searches that use skipping.

The CompoundFileWriter buffer is created only briefly, so I think we
can use a fairly large (32 KB?) buffer there.  And there should not be
too many BufferedIndexOutputs alive at once so I think a large-ish
buffer (16 KB?) should be OK.

0,"refactoring of DavSession acquisition in jcr-serveri'm subclassing WebdavServer, and i want to use my own logic for finding credentials in the request, logging into the repository and instantiating a DavSession.

unfortunately, WebdavServlet.getSession and its friend the inner class DavSessionImpl are declared private. i changed WebdavServlet.getSession to be protected so that i could override it, but even so, i have no access to DavSessionImpl, so for now, i've copied and pasted it as an inner class in my subclass. yuck.

here's a proposal for making this more extensible:

1) create the interface DavSessionProvider in org.apache.jackrabbit.server with these methods:

  public void acquireSession(WebdavRequest request) throws DavException;
  public void releaseSession(WebdavRequest request);

2) make JCRWebdavServer implement DavSessionProvider (it already includes the above methods)

3) move WebdavServlet$DavSessionImpl to DavSessionImpl in org.apache.jackrabbit.server.simple

4) create a DavSessionProviderImpl in org.apache.jackrabbit.server.simple implementing DavSessionProvider which returns instances of DavSessionImpl

5) change WebdavServlet to use a DavSessionProvider rather than its own getSession method, and use a DavSessionProviderImpl by default. subclasses can override with setDavSessionProvider().

0,"date encoding limitation removingcurrently there is some limitation to date encoding in lucene. I think it's 
because dates should preserve lexicografical ordering, i.e. if one date precedes 
another date then encoded values should keep same ordering.

I know that it can be difficult to integrate it into existing version but there 
is way to remove this limitation.
Date milliseconds can be encoded as unsigned values with prefix that indicates 
positive or negative value.

In more details:
I used hex encoding and prefix &#8216;p&#8217; and &#8216;n&#8217; for positive and negative values. I 
got following results:

Value -10000 is encoded with nffffffffffffd8f0, 
-100	- nffffffffffffff9c
0	- p0000000000000000
100	- p0000000000000064
10000	- p0000000000002710

This preserves ordering between values and theirs encoding.

Also hex encoding can be replaced with Character.MAX_RADIX encoding.

Part of code that do this work:
   final static char[] digits = {
	'0' , '1' , '2' , '3' , '4' , '5' ,
	'6' , '7' , '8' , '9' , 'a' , 'b' ,
	'c' , 'd' , 'e' , 'f' , 'g' , 'h' ,
	'i' , 'j' , 'k' , 'l' , 'm' , 'n' ,
	'o' , 'p' , 'q' , 'r' , 's' , 't' ,
	'u' , 'v' , 'w' , 'x' , 'y' , 'z'
    };


    char prefix;
    if (time >= 0) {
      prefix = 'p';
    } else {
      prefix = 'n';
    }

    char[] chars = new char[DATE_LEN + 1];
    int index = DATE_LEN;
    while (time != 0) {
      int b = (int) (time & 0x0F);
      chars[index--] = digits[b];
      time = time >>> 4;
    }

0,"Benchmarks Enhancements (precision/recall, TREC, Wikipedia)Would be great if the benchmark contrib had a way of providing precision/recall benchmark information ala TREC.  I don't know what the copyright issues are for the TREC queries/data (I think the queries are available, but not sure about the data), so not sure if the is even feasible, but I could imagine we could at least incorporate support for it for those who have access to the data.  It has been a long time since I have participated in TREC, so perhaps someone more familiar w/ the latest can fill in the blanks here.

Another option is to ask for volunteers to create queries and make judgments for the Reuters data, but that is a bit more complex and probably not necessary.  Even so, an Apache licensed set of benchmarks may be useful for the community as a whole.  Hmmm.... 

Wikipedia might be another option instead of Reuters to setup as a download for benchmarking, as it is quite large and I believe the licensing terms are quite amenable.  Having a larger collection would be good for stressing Lucene more and would give many users a demonstration of how Lucene handles large collections.

At any rate, this kind of information could be useful for people looking at different indexing schemes, formats, payloads and different query strategies.

0,"URI.parseUriReference treats strings with leading ':' as absolute URIs with zero-length schemeURI.parseUriReference treats strings with leading ':' as absolute URIs with a
zero-length scheme. If you then try to derelativize such a URI against a base
URI, you just get the same URI with leading ':'. 

IE and Firefox treat URI strings with a leading ':' as relative URIs. For
example, an HREF of "":foo"" in the context of base URI
""http://www.example.com/path/page"" would derelativize as
""http://www.example.com/path/:foo"". (Only if another character comes before the
colon is it interpreted as a URI scheme.)

It'd be desirable for HTTPClient URI to do the same thing.

Example code to demonstrate:

import org.apache.commons.httpclient.URI;
URI base = new URI(""http://www.example.com/path/page"");
URI rel1 = new URI("":foo/boo"");
System.out.println((new URI(base,rel1)).toString()); // displays just "":foo""

A potential fix would be for URI.parseUriReference() to avoid interpreting a ':'
in the zero position as indicating a zero-length scheme:

-       if (atColon < 0 || (atSlash >= 0 && atSlash < atColon)) {
+       if (atColon <= 0 || (atSlash >= 0 && atSlash < atColon)) {

and

-        if (at < length && tmp.charAt(at) == ':') {
+        if (at > 0 && at < length && tmp.charAt(at) == ':') {"

0,"Add NumericField, make plain text numeric parsers public in FieldCache, move trie parsers to FieldCacheIn discussions about LUCENE-1673, Mike & me wanted to add a new NumericField to o.a.l.document specific for easy indexing. An alternative would be to add a NumericUtils.newXxxField() factory, that creates a preconfigured Field instance with norms and tf off, optionally a stored text (LUCENE-1699) and the TokenStream already initialized. On the other hand NumericUtils.newXxxSortField could be moved to NumericSortField.

I and Yonik tend to use the factory for both, Mike tends to create the new classes.

Also the parsers for string-formatted numerics are not public in FieldCache. As the new SortField API (LUCENE-1478) makes it possible to support a parser in SortField instantiation, it would be good to have the static parsers in FieldCache public available. SortField would init its member variable to them (instead of NULL), so making code a lot easier (FieldComparator has this ugly null checks when retrieving values from the cache).

Moving the Trie parsers also as static instances into FieldCache would make the code cleaner and we would be able to hide the ""hack"" StopFillCacheException by making it private to FieldCache (currently its public because NumericUtils is in o.a.l.util)."

0,"UserManagement: membership cache default size too smallThe membership cache that has been introduced in JCR-2703 is making use of an LRUMap to cache group memberships (authorizable nodeId -> group nodeIds). In environments where users belong to more than 100 groups, the cache quickly becomes ineffective due to the default maximum size of the LRUMap.

Once the cache limit is hit, the rather expensive Node#getWeakReferences API calls resulting in search queries are executed again, leading to quite noticeable performance drops. Thus I'd suggest to either make the membership cache configurable or introduce some logic to let the cache grow dynamically as needed (still having some kind of hard limit to avoid memory issues)."
0,"Re-add SorterTemplate and use it to provide fast ArraySorting and replace BytesRefHash sortingThis patch adds back an optimized and rewritten SorterTemplate back to Lucene (removed after release of 3.0). It is of use for several components:

- Automaton: Automaton needs to sort States and other things. Using Arrays.sort() is slow, because it clones internally to ensure stable search. This component is much faster. This patch adds Arrays.sort() replacements in ArrayUtil that work with natural order or using a Comparator<?>. You can choose between quickSort and mergeSort.
- BytesRefHash uses another QuickSort algorithm without insertionSort for very short ord arrays. This class uses SorterTemplate to provide the same with insertionSort fallback in a very elegant way. Ideally this class can be used everywhere, where the sort algorithm needs to be separated from the underlying data and you can implement a swap() and compare() function (that get slot numbers instead of real values). This also applies to Solr (Yonik?).

SorterTemplate provides quickSort and mergeSort algorithms. Internally for short arrays, it automatically chooses insertionSort (like JDK's Arrays). The quickSort algorith was copied modified from old BytesRefHash. This new class only shares MergeSort with the original CGLIB SorterTemplate, which is no longer maintained."

0,"RepositoryFactory implementation for jcr2spiThere should be a RepositoryFactory implementation in jcr2spi that also covers acquiring the underlying RepositoryService.

For this purpose I suggest to create:
-  a RepositoryServiceFactory in jackrabbit-spi, which encapsulates the spi implementation specifc instantiation of the RepositoryService. the factory probably just needs a single method that takes a parameters map.
- a RepositoryFactory implementation in jcr2spi, which works with a URI that contains all required information to connect/acquired the RepositoryService.

To use jcr2spi/spi2jcr/jackrabbit-core:
- jcr+file://path/to/repository/home?config=repository.xml

To use jcr2spi/spi2dav:
- jcr+dav://localhost:8080/server/repository/?br=4

To use jcr2spi/spi2davex:
- jcr+davex://localhost:8080/server/repository/

An implementation of RepositoryServiceFactory must check the scheme and decide if it can handle it and create a RepositoryService instance with it, otherwise it must return null. This means there would be a single name for the connect URI for all RepositoryServiceFactory implementations.

0,"Optimization for IndexWriter.addIndexes()One big performance problem with IndexWriter.addIndexes() is that it has to optimize the index both before and after adding the segments.  When you have a very large index, to which you are adding batches of small updates, these calls to optimize make using addIndexes() impossible.  It makes parallel updates very frustrating.

Here is an optimized function that helps out by calling mergeSegments only on the newly added documents.  It will try to avoid calling mergeSegments until the end, unless you're adding a lot of documents at once.

I also have an extensive unit test that verifies that this function works correctly if people are interested.  I gave it a different name because it has very different performance characteristics which can make querying take longer."

0,"SimpleFieldsHelper emits a lot warningsThe SimpleFieldsHelper.retrieveSimpleField method is used to load JCR properties into simple Java object fields according to the mapping descriptor. If the node does not have the named property, a WARN message is emited.

If the missing property is defined as optional in the node type definition, it is quite normal, that it may be missing. Therefore emitting a WARN message does not seem appropriate. It would be better, to do the following (in order):

   If the missing property is declared to be required in the descriptor, throw an exception
   else if the descriptor has a default value for the missing property, use that value
   else if the property is defined with a default value in the node type definition, use that value
   else emit a DEBUG message and leave the field undefined

That's why I propose to use an interface instead. The default implementation could still delegate to =java.util.BitSet=.

0,"Regex support and beyond in JavaCC QueryParserSince the early days the standard query parser was limited to the queries living in core, adding other queries or extending the parser in any way always forced people to change the grammar file and regenerate. Even if you change the grammar you have to be extremely careful how you modify the parser so that other parts of the standard parser are affected by customisation changes. Eventually you had to live with all the limitation the current parser has like tokenizing on whitespaces before a tokenizer / analyzer has the chance to look at the tokens. 
I was thinking about how to overcome the limitation and add regex support to the query parser without introducing any dependency to core. I added a new special character that basically prevents the parser from interpreting any of the characters enclosed in the new special characters. I choose the forward slash  '/' as the delimiter so that everything in between two forward slashes is basically escaped and ignored by the parser. All chars embedded within forward slashes are treated as one token even if it contains other special chars like * []?{} or whitespaces. This token is subsequently passed to a pluggable ""parser extension"" with builds a query from the embedded string. I do not interpret the embedded string in any way but leave all the subsequent work to the parser extension. Such an extension could be another full featured query parser itself or simply a ctor call for regex query. The interface remains quiet simple but makes the parser extendible in an easy way compared to modifying the javaCC sources.

The downsides of this patch is clearly that I introduce a new special char into the syntax but I guess that would not be that much of a deal as it is reflected in the escape method though. It would truly be nice to have more than once extension an have this even more flexible so treat this patch as a kickoff though.

Another way of solving the problem with RegexQuery would be to move the JDK version of regex into the core and simply have another method like:
{code}
protected Query newRegexQuery(Term t) {
  ... 
}
{code}

which I would like better as it would be more consistent with the idea of the query parser to be a very strict and defined parser.

I will upload a patch in a second which implements the extension based approach I guess I will add a second patch with regex in core soon too.

0,"UUID generation: SecureRandom should be used by defaultCurrently, the UUID generation used the regular java.util.Random implementation to generate random UUIDs. The seed value of Random is initialized using System.currentTimeMillis(); for Windows, the resolution is about 15 milliseconds. That means two computer that start creating UUIDs with Jackrabbit within the same 15 millisecond interval will generate the same UUIDs. In a clustered environment the nodes could be started automatically at the same time (for example after a backup).

Also, the Random class uses a 48-bit seed, which is much less than the number of random bits in UUID (122). This is not secure. See also:

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UUID
Random UUID probability of duplicates
""The probability [of duplicates] also depends on the quality of the random number generator. A cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator must be used to generate the values, otherwise the probability of duplicates may be significantly higher.""

Therefore, I suggest to change VersionFourGenerator to use the SecureRandom implementation in by default."

0,"Tests using Version.LUCENE_CURRENT will produce problems in backwards branch, when development for 3.2 startsA lot of tests for the most-recent functionality in Lucene use Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, which is fine in trunk, as we use the most recent version without hassle and changing this in later versions.

The problem is, if we copy these tests to backwards branch after 3.1 is out and then start to improve analyzers, we then will have the maintenance hell for backwards tests. And we loose backward compatibility testing for older versions. If we would specify a specific version like LUCENE_31 in our tests, after moving to backwards they must work without any changes!

To not always modify all tests after a new version comes out (e.g. after switching to 3.2 dev), I propose to do the following:
- declare a static final Version TEST_VERSION = Version.LUCENE_CURRENT (or better) Version.LUCENE_31 in LuceneTestCase(4J).
- change all tests that use Version.LUCENE_CURRENT using eclipse refactor to use this constant and remove unneeded import statements.

When we then move the tests to backward we must only change one line, depending on how we define this constant:
- If in trunk LuceneTestCase it's Version.LUCENE_CURRENT, we just change the backwards branch to use the version numer of the released thing.
- If trunk already uses the LUCENE_31 constant (I prefer this), we do not need to change backwards, but instead when switching version numbers we just move trunk forward to the next major version (after added to Version enum)."
0,"[PATCH] FuzzyTermEnum optimization and refactorI took a look at it to see if it could be improved.  I saw speed improvements of
20% - 40% by making a couple changes.  

The patch is here: http://www.hagerfamily.com/patches/FuzzyTermEnumOptimizePatch.txt

The Patch is based on the HEAD of the CVS tree as of Oct 22, 2004.

What Changed?

Since the word was discarded if the edit distance for the word was
above a certain threshold, I updated the distance algorithm to abort
if at any time during the calculation it is determined that the best
possible outcome of the edit distance algorithm is above this
threshold.  The source code has a great explanation.

I also reduced the amount of floating point math, reduced the amount
of potential space the array takes in its first dimension, removed the
potential divide by 0 error when one term is an empty string, and
fixed a bug where an IllegalArgumentException was thrown if the class
was somehow initialized wrong, instead of looking at the arguments.

The behavior is almost identical.  The exception is that similarity is
set to 0.0 when it is guaranteed to be below the minimum similarity.

Results

I saw the biggest improvement from longer words, which makes a sense.
My long word was ""bridgetown"" and I saw a 60% improvement on this.
The biggest improvement are for words that are farthest away from the
median length of the words in the index.  Short words (1-3 characters)
saw a 30% improvement.  Medium words saw a 10% improvement (5-7
characters).  These improvements are with the prefix set to 0."

2. (optionally) make the requestBody and parameters members protected instead

0,"Making Term Vectors more accessibleOne of the big issues with term vector usage is that the information is loaded into parallel arrays as it is loaded, which are then often times manipulated again to use in the application (for instance, they are sorted by frequency).

Adding a callback mechanism that allows the vector loading to be handled by the application would make this a lot more efficient.

I propose to add to IndexReader:
abstract public void getTermFreqVector(int docNumber, String field, TermVectorMapper mapper) throws IOException;
and a similar one for the all fields version

Where TermVectorMapper is an interface with a single method:
void map(String term, int frequency, int offset, int position);

The TermVectorReader will be modified to just call the TermVectorMapper.  The existing getTermFreqVectors will be reimplemented to use an implementation of TermVectorMapper that creates the parallel arrays.  Additionally, some simple implementations that automatically sort vectors will also be created.

0,"Selective disabling of checks in ItemValidatorI would like to be able to selectively disable checks in ItemValidator in the scope of an operation performed through methods of the SessionState class.

This approach is very error prone and not very DRY.

With my upcoming patch in place, setting a protected property would look like this:

final Node parent = ...

1,"addIndexesNoOptimize intermittantly throws incorrect ""segment exists in external directory..."" exceptionSpinoff from here:

    http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/lucene-java-user/200809.mbox/%3Cba72f77f0809111418l29cf215dnd45bf679832d7d42%40mail.gmail.com%3E

Here's my response on that thread:

The bug only happens when you call addIndexesNoOptimize, and one
simple workaround would be to use SerialMergeScheduler.

I think this is already fixed in trunk (soonish to be 2.4) as a side
effect of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-1335.

In 2.3, merges that involve external segments (which are segments
folded in by addIndexesNoOptimize) are not supposed to run in a BG
thread.  This is to prevent addIndexesNoOptimize from returning until
after all external segments have been carried over (merged or copied)
into the index, so that if there is an exception (eg disk full),
addIndexesNoOptimize is able to rollback to the index to the starting
point.

The primary merge() method of CMS indeed does not BG any external
merges, but the bug is that when a BG merge finishes it then selects a
new merge to kick off and that selection is happy to pick an external
segment."
1,"DocValues merging is not associative, leading to different results depending upon how merges executerecently I cranked up TestDuelingCodecs to actually test docvalues (previously it wasn't testing it at all).

This test is simple, it indexes the same random content with 2 different indexwriters, it just allows them
to use different codecs with different indexwriterconfigs.

then it asserts the indexes are equal.

Sometimes, always on BYTES_FIXED_DEREF type, we end out with one reader that has a zero-filled byte[] for a doc,
but that same document in the other reader has no docvalues at all.
"
1,"FieldCache.getStringIndex should not throw exception if term count exceeds doc countSpinoff of LUCENE-2133/LUCENE-831.

Currently FieldCache cannot handle more than one value per field.
We may someday want to fix that... but until that day:

FieldCache.getStringIndex currently does a simplistic check to try to
catch when you've accidentally allowed more than one term per field,
by testing if the number of unique terms exceeds the number of
documents.

The problem is, this is not a perfect check, in that it allows false
negatives (you could have more than one term per field for some docs
and the check won't catch you).

Further, the exception thrown is the unchecked RuntimeException.

So this means... you could happily think all is good, until some day,
well into production, once you've updated enough docs, suddenly the
check will catch you and throw an unhandled exception, stopping all
searches [that need to sort by this string field] in their tracks.
It's not gracefully degrading.

I think we should simply remove the test, ie, if you have more terms
than docs then the terms simply overwrite one another.

1,"JNDI Referencable IssuesI'm questioning the use of Referencable in the BindableResource and BindableResourceFactory classes for the JNDI lookup process. Reason for this is because Referencable needs the Addrs to be in the EXACT order in order for it to be considered the same. (see http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/javax/naming/Reference.html#equals(java.lang.Object) )

In order for me to get the JNDI reference to be found correctly I had to change the BindableResource.getReference method to swap the order the StringReferences were added to match up what was being passed in by glassfish. This seems EXTREMELY fragile to me as I don't know what order, say JBoss, would pass the StringRefences in in the Reference object for the Factory method.

Also, another problem is that getReference is binding the class name to BindableRepository class implementation and not javax.jcr.Repository. This again causes them not to match if you follow the example on the wiki on setting up the JNDI reference and use javax.jcr.Repository as the type. This can either be fixed by changing the JNDI reference to use the BindableRepository class or the change the BindableRepository class to set that to the Repository interface. Not sure which would be considered 'better'

I have a patch that fixes the first issue (at least for glassfish), but not the second. Again, this seems like a really 'breakable' setup right now and not sure what would be better to make sure this is avoided."
1,"fix assertions/checks that use File.length() to use getFilePointer()This came up on this thread ""Getting RuntimeException: after flush: fdx size mismatch while Indexing"" 
(http://www.lucidimagination.com/search/document/a8db01a220f0a126)

In trunk, a side effect of the codec refactoring is that these assertions were pushed into codecs as finish() before close().
they check getFilePointer() instead in this computation, which checks that lucene did its part (instead of falsely tripping if directory metadata is stale).

I think we should fix these checks/asserts on 3.x too

1,"/contrib/orm-persistence/ OJBPersistenceManagerOJBPersistenceManager seems to have the following problems

1. OJBPersistenceBroker inherites from AbstractPersistenceBroker. There's no 
need of using a non transactional implementation as the feature is available in 
jdbc. 

2. A single broker is used and It's not thread-safe. This is not a problem now 
because it inherits from AbstractPersistenceManager, and the store(ChangeLog ) 
method is synchronized.

3. The broker is never closed so it leaves an open connection.

4. There's no pooling with only one broker.

5 Each write method (e.g. store(NodeState state)) starts its own transaction 
but the transaction should start and end in store(ChangeLog log).

6. It never rollbacks, even when an item in the changelog can't be persisted.

7. The mysql example create MyISAM tables which don't support transactions. 
Innodb tables would be more appropriate.

8. jdbc to java type mapping is wrong for

1,"Mixin type lossWhen using a bundle persistence manager, the mixin type information may be corrupted in the lucene index, causing queries like '//element(*, my:mixin)' to fail.



The problem is that the 'jcr:mixinTypes' may be stored in the bundle. Here is how this could happen :


First step: Create a node and add a mixin 'A'.

Everything's fine. The query '//element(*, 'A')' works.


Second step : Select the node and add a second mixin 'B'.

When the second mixin is added, the AbstractBundlePersistenceManager#load(PropertyId) is called to get the current mixins for the node. This method will store the PropertyState for 'jcr:mixinTypes' in the bundle (containing only the mixin 'A'). Then the NodeImpl#setMixinTypesProperty() will set the PropertyState for 'jcr:mixinTypes' in the node state (containing the mixins 'A' and 'B').
When the session is saved, the ChangeLog in AbstractBundlePersistenceManager#store() contains a modification for the 'jcr:mixinTypes' but it's being ignored, leaving the bundle with only mixin 'A'. The NodeIndexer looks into the node state to get the mixin types and indexes the node correctly. The queries '//element(*, 'A')' and '//element(*, 'B')' work.


Thrid step : Select the node and update a property. 

When the session is saved, the NodeIndexer asks again for the 'jcr:mixinTypes' property, by calling the AbstractBundlePersistenceManager#load(PropertyId) to load it. The bundle contains this property and returns only mixin 'A' (as it was stored in the second step), causing the index to use only mixin 'A'. The query '//element(*, 'A')' still works but '//element(*, 'B') doesn't work anymore.



A simple solution to this would be to not store the PropertyState for the 'jcr:mixinTypes' (and 'jcr:uuid' and 'jcr:primaryType', as the class description states) in the bundle when the PropertyState is loaded. It would fix the issue but not the contents on existing repositories. One way to allow the repositories to fix themselves is to not read or write these 3 properties in the BundleBinding#readBundle and BundleBinding#writeBundle methods, but I'm not sure wether or not it would have a performance impact.

It seems that the copying of the listeners triggered this exception:

    private void notifyRegistered(QName ntName) {
        // copy listeners to array to avoid ConcurrentModificationException
        NodeTypeRegistryListener[] la =
                new NodeTypeRegistryListener[listeners.size()];
        Iterator iter = listeners.values().iterator();
        int cnt = 0;
1750:   while (iter.hasNext()) {
            la[cnt++] = (NodeTypeRegistryListener) iter.next();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < la.length; i++) {
            if (la[i] != null) {
                la[i].nodeTypeRegistered(ntName);
            }
        }
    }

The methods ""notifyReRegistered"" and ""notifyUnregistered"" will probably suffer from the same problem.

Reproduction of this exception may be tricky; it only occurred once in our application. It is probably a race condition: another thread might access the listeners during the copy. It may be helpful to use a debugger and set a breakpoint in the middle of the copy giving other threads the opportunity to access the listeners...

We think that a possible solution is the following:

    /**
     * Notify the listeners that a node type <code>ntName</code> has been registered.
     */
    private void notifyRegistered(QName ntName) {
        // copy listeners to array to avoid ConcurrentModificationException
    	NodeTypeRegistryListener[] la;
    	synchronized (listeners) {
            la = (NodeTypeRegistryListener[]) listeners.values().toArray(new NodeTypeRegistryListener[listeners.size()]);
		}

        for (int i = 0; i < la.length; i++) {
            if (la[i] != null) {
                la[i].nodeTypeRegistered(ntName);
            }
        }
    }

1,"Destination URI should be normalizedWebdavRequestImpl.getHrefLocator tests if the URI passed as parameter starts with the context path, and passes the next segments to the locator factory.
 
There is a potential hole if the parameter contains "".."", because ""http://example.com/dav/../foo"" starts with the context path ""http://example.com/dav"" but represents to ""http://example.com/foo"". Currently, it is up to the locator factory to detect this situation, meaning that every locator factory should implement this check. Additionally, DavLocatorFactory.createResourceLocator cannot throw exceptions, hence it would not fail cleanly (RuntimeException causing a 500 INTERNAL SERVER ERROR response, when a 403 FORBIDDEN status code would have been apropriate)

Note that the Request-URI should have already been normalized by the servlet container, but in COPY/MOVE operations, the Destination-URI is not normalized.

Conformant clients MUST NOT use dot-segments (""."" or "".."")  [RFC 4918, Section 8.3] in Simple-Ref constructions such as the Destination header [RFC 4918, Section 10.3]), but the server should be able to detect this error.

Proposed change in WebdavRequestImpl:193 (in package org.apache.jackrabbit.webdav from webdav/java)
- ref = uri.getRawPath();
+ ref = uri.normalize().getRawPath();

When IndexWriter hits an OOME, it records this and then if close() is
called it calls rollback() instead.  This is a defensive measure, in
case the OOME corrupted the internal buffered state (added/deleted
docs).

But there's a bug: if you opened IndexWriter with autoCommit true,
close() then incorrectly throws an IllegalStatException.

This fix is simple: allow rollback to be called even if autoCommit is
true, internally during close.  (External calls to rollback with
autoCommmit true is still not allowed).

1,".war distribution should be configurable, prompting you to setup JNDI with the Repository Home and Config locations.The Embedded Deployment Model documentation (http://jackrabbit.apache.org/doc/deploy/howto-model1.html) on the jackrabbit page describes how to package up a .war file so that you can use JNDI Resource settings to change the location of the repository home and the repository configuration xml file.

Unfortunately, the .war file that is provided as part of the Jackrabbit distribution doesn't behave like this. Instead, it has an inbuilt repository.xml file and settings in web.xml that act as defaults. These defaults are not useful and force a user to act like a developer and modify the files within the .war file.

The current situation is that we have a .war that's not going to be useful to anyone without modification. The repository.xml file that is contained within the .war makes the repository home to be the Tomcat/bin/repository directory. This is not a useful default. It's better to have no default setup and a clear error message that JNDI needs to be setup. It would be even better if the web application could recognise when the JNDI wasn't configured and could prompt the user with an instructional webpage, describing how to setup the required JNDI settings on Tomcat, JBoss etc.

----

The .war distribution for Jackrabbit ignores the JNDI settings that are described in the documentation. I am using this Tomcat config.xml snippet to configure Tomcat 5.5:

{{{
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<Context displayName=""Ark"" docBase=""c:\dev\ark\jackrabbit-server-1.1.1.war"" path=""/ark""

          configFilePath=""c:/dev/ark/src/main/resources/repository.xml""
          repHomeDir=""c:/jackrabbitrepo""/>

</Context>
}}}

Jackrabbit loads fine. However, the logs show:

----

My use case is that I want to use Jackrabbit to host a Maven 2 repository within my company. So, ideally I want to:
   * Download the Jackrabbit .war file and mount it on my Tomcat server as context ""/maven2"".
   * Configure Tomcat to use LDAP authentication and point it at my company's LDAP server. This is a standard J2EE feature, of course.
   * Create my own repository.xml file which points to my AccessManager implementation (which goes to my company's SingleSignOn service for authorization). My AccessManager implementation will be placed on the Tomcat shared classpath.
   * Set the repository home directory, where all the working files will be placed and the location of the repository.xml file. Ideally, this would be done in JNDI.

If I have to put together my own Jackrabbit .war file, I consider that I have my ""developer"" hat on when I only really want to have my ""Jackrabbit user"" hat on.

At a certain point the second point may encounter an ItemNotFoundException with a stack trace similar to this:

1,"Merging between workspaces failsI have setup 2 workspaces in Jackrabbit.  I have a preview and a production
workspace.  These workspaces keep a tree of menu nodes that can have content
associated to those menus.  Each node is of type nt:unstructured and has
mixin types of versionable, lockable, and referenceable.

In our system you are only allowed to edit nodes in the preview workspace.
So what I do is when you go to edit a node we check it out, allow for edits,
then check it in.  This creates a new version on the node.  Then we merge
the node up to the production workspace.  All nodes in the production
workspace are always checked in and not locked.

When I go to do a merge I run into problems when I try to merge a node that
has children.  Lets say I have node A with children B and C.  These all have
the same node types as stated above.  I make a change to a property in Node
A in the preview workspace and now want to merge it into the production
workspace (where it exists already).  Here is the code that is run:

Node destNode = destSession.getNodeByUUID(getUUID());
NodeIterator ni = destNode.merge(""preview"", true);

Now this fails in the ItemImpl.internalRemove() method with a
VersionException of cannot remove a child of a checked-in node.  Here is the
trace for the error:
at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.ItemImpl.internalRemove(ItemImpl.java:848)

at org.apache.jackrabbit.core.NodeImpl.merge(NodeImpl.java:3003)

Now if I understand correctly when doing a merge the node that you are
trying to merge to needs to be older then the source node and the
destination node cannot be checked out (NodeImpl.doMergeTest() is where I
figured that out).  But then when I step through further in the merge in
NodeImpl it gets all the nodes of the src node and retrieves the same
children in the destination workspace and then tries to remove those
destination children but it can't remove those children b/c the parent node
(which is node A in the production workspace) is not checked out, but
according to the mergeTest it can't be checked out or the merge won't even
begin."

1,"Bundle persistence managers node id key store/load is not symertric on MySql causing NoSuchItemState Exceptions It looks like the binary values read back from MySql where the UUID contains 0's is not the same as that generated from the UUID getRawBytes() call. As result, you can store a node with the UUID that has 0's but its never found when read back. This therefore causes corruption in random places when certain UUIDs are generated.

Test Case: 

I've attached 2 files. One causes node corruption when imported, the other does not.
The only difference is that I removed any 0 values from the problem UUID in the file that causes corruption.

As Stefan pointed out, I had manipulated the test case to use standard nt types when in fact I should have provided the following info (sorry Stefan) e.g. the test folder types are referencable hence the jcr:uuid allocation

[acme:Folder] > nt:folder, mix:referenceable

If I import works.xml then ""ls"" works fine for the same node as I've manually changed the UUID to replace 0s with 1s in the last section.

Testing shows this issue highlights a problem with the Bundle persistence manager and MySqls method of handling BINARY columns.
The solution looks to be to replace BINARY(16) with VARBINARY(16). Quoting from http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/binary-varbinary.html...
""If the value retrieved must be the same as the value specified for storage with no padding, it might be preferable to use VARBINARY or one of the BLOB data types instead.""
A review of our logs shows that all of the corruption we've seen has related to nodes with UUIDs including 0's.

* Shall I log a JIRA ticket for this?
* Anyone see any issues with this fix?


In the following example you can see I'm showing all bundles in the ""test1"" workspace.

mysql> select hex(node_id) from test1_bundle;
+----------------------------------+
| hex(node_id)                     |

| DEADBEEFCAFEBABECAFEBABECAFEBABE |
+----------------------------------+
5 rows in set (0.00 sec)

...but a select using the same UUID hex value returns no rows.

mysql>  select node_id from test1_bundle where 
mysql> unhex('A55F3F6BA9094E8DB65A93002CED0920') = node_id;
Empty set (0.00 sec)

I've then created a new ""test3"" workspace which I modified to use varbinary instead of binary with:

alter table test3_bundle modify NODE_ID varbinary(16); alter table test3_refs modify NODE_ID varbinary(16);

My import test case now no longer fails and the following query proves that query operations, after a store, return rows as expected.

mysql>  select node_id from test3_bundle where 
mysql> unhex('A55F3F6BA9094E8DB65A93002CED0920') = node_id;

husband&wife@talktalk.net gets broken into ""husband"" and ""wife@talktalk.net""

These seem to be occurring more often. The first seems to be because of an anti-spam trick you can use with google (see: http://labnol.blogspot.com/2007/08/gmail-plus-smart-trick-to-find-block.html). I see the second in several domains but a disproportionate amount are from talktalk.net, so I expect it's a signup suggestion from the service.

1,"method.getURI()  returns escaped URIs but it shouldn'tHi guys,

Please, consider the following imaginary and simplified code:


URI u = new URI(""http://some.host.com/%41.html"", true);
HttpClient httpClient = new HttpClient();
GetMethod method = new GetMethod();
method.setURI(u);
URI u2 = method.getURI();

System.out.println(""1. "" + u);
System.out.println(""2. "" + new String(u.getRawURI()));
System.out.println(""3. "" + u.getURI());
System.out.println(""4. "" + u2);
System.out.println(""5. "" + new String(u2.getRawURI()));
System.out.println(""6. "" + u2.getURI());


The result that you'll get is:

1. http://some.host.com/%41.html
2. http://some.host.com/%41.html
3. http://some.host.com/A.html
4. http://some.host.com/%2541.html
5. http://some.host.com/%2541.html
6. http://some.host.com/%41.html


You can see that for lines 4, 5, and 6, the URI suddenly gets escaped (the 
percent sign gets converted to %25).

Why is that? Am I doing something wrong? Is this the desired behaviour? I would 
have expected to get the SAME URI back, without any escaping.

Besides, I have another question:

After executing a method -- httpClient.executeMethod(method) -- what will 
method.getURI() return? The URI *after* all redirections or the original URI? 
It seems I get the URI *after* the redirections, which is fine, but the 
documentation doesn't say that. It only explicitly says that the getPath() 
method has that behaviour.

Best regards and thanks,
Bisser"
1,"RepositoryImpl.acquireRepositoryLock() fails to detect that the file lock is already held by the current processwith java 1.4 and 1.5 on a *nix-based platform it is possible to (concurrently) instantiate 
more than one repository instance in the same jvm based on same/identical configurations.

this is a critical issue since it might lead to data corruption.

the issue only exists with java versions prior to 1.6 and *nix-based platforms (only verified
on mac os-x 10.4).

note that the issue does not exist when the file lock is held by another jvm.

 code snippet to reproduce the issue:

            Repository rep1 = new TransientRepository();
            Session s1 = rep1.login(new SimpleCredentials(""johndoe"", """".toCharArray()));
            Repository rep2 = new TransientRepository();
            Session s2 = rep2.login(new SimpleCredentials(""johndoe"", """".toCharArray()));


the root problem is the incorrect behavior of java.nio.channels.FileChannel#tryLock()
which is demonstrated by the following code snippet:

            try {
                FileLock fl1 = new FileOutputStream(""foo"").getChannel().tryLock();
                System.out.println(""1st lock: "" + fl1);

1,"RMI published Repository using the jcr-rmi library gets lost over timeThe jcr-server/webapp project contains a servlet - RepositoryStartupServlet - which may be used in a web app to start a repository and optionally register the repository with JNDI and RMI. To register the repository with JNDI, the jcr-rmi library is used to create a Remote repository instance, which is registered with the RMI registry. Inside the RMI implementation mechanisms based on stub classes created by the RMI compiler are created to make the remote repository available remotely. This includes creating a object table to map remote references to local objects. This table stores references to the local object as weak references to support distributed garbage collection.

Over time, it may now be that this remote repository instance is actually collected and the object table cannot access it anymore thus preventing the repository from being accessed remotely. To prevent this from happening, the RepositoryStartupServlet must keep a strong reference to the remote repository and drop this reference when the servlet is destroyed and the repository unregistered.

In version 3.1 of HttpClient all works well, but in 4.0 I get a timeout exception in the second request, after ~10 seconds, which means the first timeout is used.

Looking at the code, I see that in version 3.1, the HttpMethodDirector.executeWithRetry() method invokes a method named applyConnectionParams() that took care of setting the timeout taken from the request on the socket. 

But in version 4.0, the only place I see the timeout is set on the socket is when DefaultRequestDirector.execute(HttpHost, HttpRequest, HttpContext) opens a connection using the managedConn.open() method. Since the connection is reused between the requests, the second request uses a socket with a timeout of the first request.

(1) multiple setProperty() with same property name on the same node (newly created or already existent)
=> With the 3. setProperty() (and sometimes also the 5.), a StaleItemStateException for the property state is raised when the transaction is commited. Following setProperty invocations will not fail!

Scenario B (deleteNode):
(1) iterate 10 times:
(1.1) create new node n and a subnode for n
(1.2) delete node n
=> Deletion of node n raises a StaleItemStateException for node n in iteration 1, 3 and (6 or 7), when the related transaction is commited. Following deletions of node n will also fail with a predictable pattern.

The Exception trace for scenario A (it's the same for scenario B, with one difference: StaleItemStateException is raised for the node and not for the property):

When debugging into jackrabbit you will see, that the cause of the StaleItemStateException is, that the local state und the overlayed state differ in the value of the 'modCount' attribute: modCount of local state is lower than modCount of overlayed state. Perhaps its a state caching problem...
	
I'm attaching a simple java application configured with maven and ready to run standalone. The JCA container of JBoss is therefore replaced with jencks in order to support distributed transactions. The configured repository uses the InMemPersistenceManager. Both scenarios are implemented in a TestNG - test, that catches the occuring TransactionExceptions and prints out the stacktrace. Therefore you will see the exceptions, but the tests will not fail."
1,BitVector never skips fully populated bytes when writing ClearedDgapsWhen writing cleared DGaps in BitVector we compare a byte against 0xFF (255) yet the byte is casted into an int (-1) and the comparison will never succeed. We should mask the byte with 0xFF before comparing or compare against -1

1,"DocViewSaxEventGenerator may generate non-NS-wellformed XMLThe XML serialization code relies on the fact that all required prefix-to-uri mappings are known beforehand (actually, when serializing the root node). So there's an assumption that the permanent namespace registry will never change during serialization, which may be incorrect when another client adds namespace registrations while the XML export is in progress.

To fix this, ""addNamespacePrefixes"" should ensure that namespace declarations have been written for all prefixes used on the current node (node name + properties), potentially going back to the namespace resolver when needed.

(Should there be consensus for that change I'm happy to give it a try)"
1,"Proxy NTLM Authentication  Redirecting to different address fails saying Proxy Auth Required.The issue has been discussed in,
http://www.nabble.com/redirect-fails-when-NTLM-authentication-is-used-for-proxy-tt23867531.html

This was found in http client 3.1 release,  where NTLM proxy authentication is must and the server ask the redirect to a new url, in this case, when redirecting, the earlier proxy auth status is not cleared, so, it does not do proxy authentication for the new URL and hence fails.

Target Host Authenticaiton NTLM authentication - redirect also had problem and fixed as said,
http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HTTPCLIENT-211
Proxy Authentication - redirect has to be fixed,

as getName() is a string and nodeTypeName is a Name this will always be false. Perhaps you meant

1,"jcr2spi: Item.isSame may return wrong result if any ancestor is invalidatedjulian detected an issue with jcr2spi that was previously shadowed due to heavy reloading of items upon save.
with the most recent changes however reloading of items is postponed until the next access. this will cause the following test to fail:

        Node n = testRootNode.addNode(""aFile"", ""nt:file"");
        n = n.addNode(""jcr:content"", ""nt:resource"");
        n.setProperty(""jcr:lastModified"", Calendar.getInstance());
        n.setProperty(""jcr:mimeType"", ""text/plain"");
        Property jcrData = n.setProperty(""jcr:data"", ""abc"", PropertyType.BINARY);
        testRootNode.save();

        // access same property through different session
        Session otherSession = helper.getReadOnlySession();
        try {
            Property otherProperty = (Property) otherSession.getItem(jcrData.getPath());
            assertTrue(jcrData.isSame(otherProperty));
        } finally {
            otherSession.logout();
        }

while 
     
       assertTrue(n.isSame(otherSession.getItem(n.getPath()));

would be successful.

the reason: the jcrData property is not reloaded and it's parent is still _invalidated_. consequently the property isn't aware of it's id having changed due to the fact that nt:resource is a node type extending from mix:referenceable.

possible fixes:

1) mark all items _invalid_ after save 
    instead of setting status non-protected/autocreated properties to EXISTING.
    -> forcing jcrData to be reloaded before isSame can be called.
    -> drawback: much more round trip(s) to the server just to make sure the id is up to date.

2) change Item#isSame to make sure the workspaceId is up to date (walking up the
     hierarchy and force reloading of the first invalidated ancestor).
     -> drawback: if referenceable nodes are rare or missing at all, this causes some
          extra round trips.
 
3) change Item.isSame to compare the 'workspacePath' instead of the 'workspaceId'.
     -> drawback: upon persisted move of a referenceable node Item#isSame will return false


after taking a closer look at the code and at some additional tests i would opt for 2).

The exception happens in the ""testNoWaitClose()"" test, which repeated
tests closing an IndexWriter with ""false"", meaning abort any
still-running merges.  When a merge is aborted it can hit various
exceptions because the files it is reading and/or writing have been
deleted, so we ignore these exceptions.

The bug was just that we were failing to properly check whether the
running merge was actually aborted because of a scoping issue of the
""merge"" variable in ConcurrentMergeScheduler.  So the exceptions are
actually ""harmless"".  Thanks to Ning for spotting it!

1,"Problem with redirect on HEAD when (bad, naughty) server returns body contentI've been testing/using HttpClient 2.0a3 with Resin 2.1.9. I've found that when
using a HEAD request on a JSP, Resin returns the body content along with the
headers.

In this case, something in the HttpClient breaks. Looking at the httpclient
logs, it looks like:

1) HttpClient does a HEAD against the original URL
2) Resin returns valid status line and headers
3) HttpClient parses the headers and recognizes the redirect header
4) HttpClient does a HEAD against the new URL (from the Location header)
5) HttpMethodBase calls readStatusLine, which (eventually) calles readRawLine in
HttpConnection (which reads from the internal inputStream)
6) readRawLine returns the first line in the body from the original HEAD request
in (1).

It looks like the original body content (in response to the first HEAD) is being
buffered somewhere, but I can't figure out where.

I know that this is invalid behavior on the server's part, but I would like to
be able to recover from it.

1,"TokenSources.getTokenStream() does not assign positionIncrementTokenSources.StoredTokenStream does not assign positionIncrement information. This means that all tokens in the stream are considered adjacent. This has implications for the phrase highlighting in QueryScorer when using non-contiguous tokens.

For example:
Consider  a token stream that creates tokens for both the stemmed and unstemmed version of each word - the fox (jump|jumped)
When retrieved from the index using TokenSources.getTokenStream(tpv,false), the token stream will be - the fox jump jumped

Now try a search and highlight for the phrase query ""fox jumped"". The search will correctly find the document; the highlighter will fail to highlight the phrase because it thinks that there is an additional word between ""fox"" and ""jumped"". If we use the original (from the analyzer) token stream then the highlighter works.

Also, consider the converse - the fox did not jump
""not"" is a stop word and there is an option to increment the position to account for stop words - (the,0) (fox,1) (did,2) (jump,4)
When retrieved from the index using TokenSources.getTokenStream(tpv,false), the token stream will be - (the,0) (fox,1) (did,2) (jump,3).

So the phrase query ""did jump"" will cause the ""did"" and ""jump"" terms in the text ""did not jump"" to be highlighted. If we use the original (from the analyzer) token stream then the highlighter works correctly."

   public final Value createValue(Node value) throws RepositoryException {
        return createValue(value.getUUID(), PropertyType.REFERENCE);
    }

to

   public final Value createValue(Node value) throws RepositoryException {
        if (value == null) {
           return null;
        }
        
        return createValue(value.getUUID(), PropertyType.REFERENCE);
    }"

The problem is that a long (as used for dates) cannot be parsed as an integer, and the next step is then to parse it as a float, which works but which is not correct. With the patch the following parsers are used in this order: int, long, float.

1,"Repository is corrupt after concurrent changes with the same sessionAfter concurrent write operations using the same session, the repository can get corrupt, meaning a ItemNotFoundException is thrown when trying to remove a node.

Concurrent write operations are not supported, however I believe the persistent state of the repository should not be get corrupt.

One way to solve this problem is to synchronize on the session internally."

1,"SloppyPhraseScorer returns non-deterministic results for queries with many repeatsProximity queries with many repeats (four or more, based on my testing) return non-deterministic results. I run the same query multiple times with the same data set and get different results.

So far I've reproduced this with Solr 1.4.1, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and latest 4.0 trunk.

Steps to reproduce (using the Solr example):
1) In solrconfig.xml, set queryResultCache size to 0.
2) Add some documents with text ""dog dog dog"" and ""dog dog dog dog"". http://localhost:8983/solr/update?stream.body=%3Cadd%3E%3Cdoc%3E%3Cfield%20name=%22id%22%3E1%3C/field%3E%3Cfield%20name=%22text%22%3Edog%20dog%20dog%3C/field%3E%3C/doc%3E%3Cdoc%3E%3Cfield%20name=%22id%22%3E2%3C/field%3E%3Cfield%20name=%22text%22%3Edog%20dog%20dog%20dog%3C/field%3E%3C/doc%3E%3C/add%3E&commit=true
3) Do a ""dog dog dog dog""~1 query. http://localhost:8983/solr/select?q=%22dog%20dog%20dog%20dog%22~1
4) Repeat step 3 many times.

Expected results: The document with id 2 should be returned.

Actual results: The document with id 2 is always returned. The document with id 1 is sometimes returned.

Different proximity values show the same bug - ""dog dog dog dog""~5, ""dog dog dog dog""~100, etc show the same behavior.

So far I've traced it down to the ""repeats"" array in SloppyPhraseScorer.initPhrasePositions() - depending on the order of the elements in this array, the document may or may not match. I think the HashSet may be to blame, but I'm not sure - that at least seems to be where the non-determinism is coming from."

1,"DataStore: garbage collection can fail when using workspace maxIdleTimeThe GarbageCollectorTest fails because some workspaces have an idle timeout. The data store garbage collector should prevent workspace close-on-idle.

Proposed solution: instead of using the 'regular' system sessions in the garbage collector, use special 'registered system sessions'. The sessions get garbage collected when no longer used, that means this patch requires that JCR-1216 ""Unreferenced sessions should get garbage collected"" is applied. So for each workspace, the code is:

// this will initialize the workspace if required
wspInfo.getSystemSession();

SessionImpl session = SystemSession.create(rep, wspInfo.getConfig());
// mark this session as 'active' for so the workspace does
// not get disposed by workspace-janitor until the garbage collector is done
rep.onSessionCreated(session);

1,"SSL connections cannot be established using resolvable IP addressHttpClient 4.1 introduced a regression in establishing SSL connections to remote peers (it seems this is a common regression for major httpclient updates, see HTTPCLIENT-803).
The new SSLSocketFactory.connectSocket method calls the X509HostnameVerifier with InetSocketAddress.getHostName() parameter. When the selected IP address has a reverse lookup name, the verifier is called with the resolved name, and so the IP check fails.
4.0 release checked for original ip/hostname, but this cannot be done with the new connectSocket() method. 
The TestHostnameVerifier.java only checks 127.0.0.1/.2 and so masked the issue, because the matching certificate has both ""localhost"" and ""127.0.0.1"", but actually only ""localhost"" is matched. A test case with 8.8.8.8 would be better."

1,"MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager does not properly respond to thread interruptsMultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager uses interrupts to notify waiting threads when a connection is ready for them. Issues arise if the threads are interrupted by someone else while they are still waiting on a thread, because doGetConnection does not remove the threads from the queue of waiting threads when they are interrupted:

                        connectionPool.wait(timeToWait);

                        // we have not been interrupted so we need to remove ourselves from the 
                        // wait queue
                        hostPool.waitingThreads.remove(waitingThread);                        connectionPool.waitingThreads.remove(waitingThread);
                    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                        // do nothing                    } finally {
                        if (useTimeout) {
                            endWait = System.currentTimeMillis();
                            timeToWait -= (endWait - startWait);                        }                    }

Under ordinary circumstances, the queue maintenance is done by the notifyWaitingThread method. However, if the thread is interrupted by any other part of the system, it will (1) not actually be released, since the loop in doGetConnection will force it back to the wait, and (2) will be added the waiting thread to the queue repeatedly, which basically means that the thread will eventually receive the interrupt from notifyWaitingThread at some later point, when it is no longer actually waiting for a connection.

This code could probably be re-architected to make it less error-prone, but the fundamental issue seems to be the use of interrupts to signal waiting threads, as opposed to something like a notify. "
1,"Value#getBinary() and #getStream() return internal representation for type PATH and NAMEjust found a path-related spi2dav test failing that passed some time before jackrabbit 2.0 (BatchTest#testSetPathValue).

i had a quick look at it and it seems to me that the reasons is the internal (Path, Name) value representation 
being exposed when calling Value#getBinary(), Value#getStream() and the corresponding shortcuts on Property.

from my understanding of the specification these methods should always return the standard JCR path (or name) representation as it
is exposed by Value#getString() and Property#getString() as it used to be in previous versions.

In fact, it should accept all combinations, so differing values for getOnParentVersionAction and other aspects should be accepted as well.

See JSR 170, 6.7.8:

""For purposes of the above, the notion of two definitions having the same name does not apply to two residual definitions. Two (or more) residual property or child node definitions with differing subattributes must be permitted to co-exist in the same effective node type. They are interpreted as disjunctive (ORed) options."""
1,"Session.save() and Session.refresh(boolean) rely on accessibility of the root nodefollow-up issue to JCR-2418:

an editing session that is only allowed to write in a subtree but isn't allowed to access the root node will not be
able to save or revert changes made in the transient space within that subtree.

the reason for this is, that both SessionImpl.save() and SessionImpl.refresh(boolean) access the root node
in order to execute the call. since it's the regular call READ permissions are checked, although the user
made no attempt to *look* at the root.

A workaround would be to call Item.save() on the modified tree itself that obviously was visible for the 
user... unfortunately that method is deprecated as of JCR 2.0. Therefore, I have the impression that we
should fix the methods mentioned above.

1,"(Parallel-)MultiSearcher: using Sort object changes the scoresExample: 
Hits hits=multiSearcher.search(query);
returns different scores for some documents than
Hits hits=multiSearcher.search(query, Sort.RELEVANCE);
(both for MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher)

The documents returned will be the same and in the same order, but the scores in the second case will seem out of order.

Inspecting the Explanation objects shows that the scores themselves are ok, but there's a bug in the normalization of the scores.

The document with the highest score should have score 1.0, so all document scores are divided by the highest score.  (Assuming the highest score was>1.0)

However, for MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher, this normalization factor is applied *per index*, before merging the results together (the merge itself is ok though).

An example: if you use
Hits hits=multiSearcher.search(query, Sort.RELEVANCE);
for a MultiSearcher with two subsearchers, the first document will have score 1.0.
The next documents from the same subsearcher will have decreasing scores.
The first document from the other subsearcher will however have score 1.0 again !

The same applies for other Sort objects, but it is less visible.

The release of the read lock needs to be done before acquiring the write lock, this is documented Concurrent library javadoc.

There is another area where there is an attempt to upgrade a read lock to write lock, RepositoryImpl.WorkspaceInfo.disposeIfIdle() acquires a read lock and calls dispose() which then acquires a write lock, this maybe ok, as I assume there is only 1 thread that will attempt to dispose of idle workspaces.

1,"When BG merge hits an exception, optimize sometimes throws an IOException missing the root cause
When IndexWriter.optimize() is called, ConcurrentMergeScheduler will
run the requested merges with background threads and optimize() will
wait for these merges to complete.

If a merge hits an exception, it records the root cause exception such
that optimize can then retrieve this root cause and throw its own
exception, with the root cause.

But there is a bug: sometimes, the fact that an exception occurred on
a merge is recorded, but the root cause is missing.  In this cause,
optimize() still throws an exception (correctly indicating that the
optimize() has not finished successfully), but it's not helpful
because it's missing the root cause.  You must then go find the root
cause in the JRE's stderr logs.

This has hit a few users on this lists, most recently:

  http://www.nabble.com/Background-merge-hit-exception-td19540409.html#a19540409

I found the isssue, and finally got a unit test to intermittently show
it.  It's a simple thread safety issue: in a finally clause in
IndexWriter.merge we record the fact that the merge hit an exception
before actually setting the root cause, and then only in
ConcurrentMergeScheduler's exception handler do we set the root
cause.  If the optimize thread is scheduled in between these two, it
can throw an exception missing its root cause.

The fix is straightforward.  I plan to commit to 2.4 & 2.9.

line 452: c.getColumnName() returns null.

The following query is fine:

select order.[customerAccountUUID] as cust from [atl:order] as order

I have been using the test case (here: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit-spi-commons/src/test/resources/org/apache/jackrabbit/spi/commons/query/sql2/test.sql2.txt?view=markup) as a guideline.

1,"coord should still apply to missing terms/clausesMissing terms in a boolean query ""disappear"" (i.e. they don't even affect the coord factor)."
1,"Phrase query with term repeated 3 times requires more slop than expectedConsider a document with the text ""A A A"".
The phrase query ""A A A"" (exact match) succeeds.
The query ""A A A""~1 (same document and query, just increasing the slop value by one) fails.
""A A A""~2 succeeds again.

If the exact match succeeds, I wouldn't expect the same query but with more slop to fail.  The fault seems to require some term to be repeated at least three times in the query, but the three occurrences do not need to be adjacent.  I will attach a file that contains a set of JUnit tests that demonstrate what I mean."
1,"Lucene is not fsync'ing files on commitThanks to hurricane Irene, when Mark's electricity became unreliable, he discovered that on power loss Lucene could easily corrumpt the index, which of course should never happen...

I was able to easily repro, by pulling the plug on an Ubuntu box during indexing.  On digging, I discovered, to my horror, that Lucene is failing to fsync any files, ever!

This bug was unfortunately created when we committed LUCENE-2328... that issue added tracking, in FSDir, of which files have been closed but not sync'd, so that when sync is called during IW.commit we only sync those files that haven't already been sync'd.

That tracking is done via the FSDir.onIndexOutputClosed callback, called when an FSIndexOutput is closed.  The bug is that we only call it on exception during close:

{noformat}

    @Override
    public void close() throws IOException {
      // only close the file if it has not been closed yet
      if (isOpen) {
        boolean success = false;
        try {
          super.close();
          success = true;
        } finally {
          isOpen = false;
          if (!success) {
            try {
              file.close();
              parent.onIndexOutputClosed(this);
            } catch (Throwable t) {
              // Suppress so we don't mask original exception
            }
          } else
            file.close();
        }
      }
    }
{noformat}

And so FSDir thinks no files need syncing when its sync method is called....

I think instead we should call it up-front; better to over-sync than under-sync.

The fix is trivial (move the callback up-front), but I'd love to somehow have a test that can catch such a bad regression in the future.... still I think we can do that test separately and commit this fix first.

Note that even though LUCENE-2328 was backported to 2.9.x and 3.0.x, this bug wasn't, ie the backport was a much simpler fix (to just address the original memory leak); it's 3.1, 3.2, 3.3 and trunk when this bug is present."
1,"Bug in UtilDateTypeConverterImplIn this converter following line is used:

1,"FSDirectory.getDirectory always creates index pathThis was reported to me as a Luke bug, but going deeper it proved to be a non-intuitive (broken?) behavior of FSDirectory.

If you use FSDirectory.getDirectory(File nonexistent) on a nonexistent path, but one that is located under some existing parent path, then FSDirectory:174 uses file.mkdirs() to create this directory. One would expect a variant of the method with a boolean flag to decide whether or not to create the output path. However, the API with ""create"" flag is now deprecated, with a comment that points to IndexWriter's ""create"" flag. This comment is misleading, because the indicated path is created anyway in the file system just by calling FSDirectory.getDirectory().

I propose to do one of the following:

* reinstate the variant of the method with ""create"" flag. In case if this flag is false, and the index directory is missing, either return null or throw an IOException,

* keep the API as it is now, but either return null or throw IOException if the index dir is missing. This breaks the backwards compatibility, because now users are required to do file.mkdirs() themselves prior to calling FSDirectory.getDirectory()."

1,"ParameterParser parse method for authentication headers does not appear to deal with empty value stringsHi, I have found an issue with HTTPClient due to the way it parses parameter 
strings.

In particular, consider the following WWW-Authenticate header:

WWW-Authenticate: Digest realm="""", algorithm=MD5, qop=""auth"", 
domain=""/content"", nonce=""0e11dcf146563c3a89e5327f0c5f5bad""
 
The realm is definitely specified, but is equal to the empty string.  It is not 
a null value.

However, the extractParams method of AuthChallengeParser which in turn calls 
ParameterParser will actually parse the value as Null  instead of an empty 
string.

This is due to parseQuotedToken getToken(true) call which essentially returns a 
null String result  as the condition i2>i1 fails :-

        String result = null;
        if (i2 > i1) {
            result = new String(chars, i1, i2 - i1);
        }
        return result;

As the processChallenge method of DigestScheme throws an exception when 
getParameter(""realm"") == null, HTTPClient is not able to process the digest 
request when an empty string realm value is present."

1,"Incorrect node position after importI have found a behavior that does not seem to be consistent with the
spec:

After replacing a node with importXML using IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING the new node is not at the position of the replaced node (talking about the position among the siblings).

The origininal node is removed, but the new node is created as the last child of the parent node, and not spec-compliant at the position of the replaced node.

Here how I use it:

// assume Session s, Node n, String text (holding XML data)

s.importXML(
	n.getPath(), 
	new ByteArrayInputStream (text.getBytes(""UTF-8"")),
	ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING
);
s.save();
 

And here a quote from the spec section 7.3.6

ImportUUIDBehavior.IMPORT_UUID_COLLISION_REPLACE_EXISTING: 
If an incoming referenceable node has the same UUID as a node already existing in the workspace then the already existing node is replaced by the incoming node in the same position as the existing node.

The problem is in the WildcardQuery rewrite function.

But, that's the rewritten prefix query which should be returned:

1,"DateTools needs to use UTC for correct collation,If your local timezone is Europe/London then the times Sun, 30 Oct 2005 00:00:00 +0000 and exactly one hour later are both converted to 200530010000 by DateTools.dateToString() with minute resolution.   The Linux date command is useful in seeing why:

    $ date --date ""Sun, 30 Oct 2005 00:00:00 +0000""
    Sun Oct 30 01:00:00 BST 2005

    $ date --date ""Sun, 30 Oct 2005 01:00:00 +0000""
    Sun Oct 30 01:00:00 GMT 2005

Both times are 1am in the morning, but one is when DST is in force, the other isn't.   Of course, these are actually different times!

Of course, if dates are stored in the index with implicit timezone information then not only do we get problems when the clocks go back at the end of summer, but we also have problems crossing timezones.   If a database is created in California and used in Paris then the times are going to be badly skewed (there's a nine hour time difference most of the year).

1,"Revision 949509 (LUCENE-2480) causes IOE ""read past EOF"" when processing older format SegmentInfo data when JVM assertion processing is disabled.At revision 949509 in org.apache.lucene.index.SegmentInfo at line 155, there is the following code:
{noformat} 
    if (format > SegmentInfos.FORMAT_4_0) {
      // pre-4.0 indexes write a byte if there is a single norms file
      assert 1 == input.readByte();
    }
{noformat} 
Note that the assert statement invokes input.readByte().
If asserts are disabled for the JVM, input.readByte() will not be invoked, causing the following readInt() to return a bogus value, and then causing an IOE during the (mistakenly entered) loop at line 165.
This can occur when processing old format (format ""-9"") index data under Tomcat (whose startup scripts by default do not turn on asserts).

Full stacktrace:

1,"fix analyzer bugs found by MockTokenizerIn LUCENE-3064, we beefed up MockTokenizer with assertions, and I've switched over the analysis tests to use MockTokenizer for better coverage.

However, this found a few bugs (one of which is LUCENE-3106):
* incrementToken() after it returns false in CommonGramsQueryFilter, HyphenatedWordsFilter, ShingleFilter, SynonymFilter
* missing end() implementation for PrefixAwareTokenFilter
* double reset() in QueryAutoStopWordAnalyzer and ReusableAnalyzerBase
* missing correctOffset()s in MockTokenizer itself.

I think it would be nice to just fix all the bugs on one issue... I've fixed everything except Shingle and Synonym"
1,"bugs in ByteArrayDataInputByteArrayDataInput has a byte[] ctor, but it doesn't actually work (some things like readVint will work, others will fail due to asserts).

The problem is it doesnt set things like limit in the ctor... I think the ctor should call reset()
Most code using this passes null to the ctor to initialize it, then uses reset(), instead they could just call ByteArrayInput(BytesRef.EMPTY_BYTES) if they want to do that.
finally, reset()'s limit looks like it should be offset + len"

1,"Search with sort fails when a document has a missing valueTesting on version: lucene-1.4-rc2

Call in question: IndexSearcher.search(Query query, Filter filter, int nDocs, 
Sort sort) 

Description: I'm making a call to search with a sort field - in my case I'm 
sorting by date. If any document in the results set (Hits) has a missing value 
in the sort field, the entire call throws an [uncaught] exception during the 
sorting process with no results returned. 

This is an undesireable result, and the prospects for patching this problem 
outside the search classes are ugly, e.g. trying to patch the index itself.

This is actually a critical function in my application. Thank you for 
addressing it.

1,"PostingsConsumer#merge does not call finishDocWe discovered that the current merge function in PostingsConsumer is not calling the #finishDoc method. This does not have consequences for the standard codec (since the lastPosition is set to 0 in #startDoc, and its #finishDoc method is empty), but for the SepCodec, this results in position file corruption (the lastPosition is set to 0 in #finishDoc for the SepCodec)."

1,"FieldSortedHitQueue - subsequent String sorts with different locales sort identicallyFrom my own post to the java-user list. I have looked into this further and am sure it's a bug.

---

It seems to me that there's a possible bug in FieldSortedHitQueue, specifically in getCachedComparator(). This is showing up on our 1.4.3 install, but it seems from source code inspection that if it's a bug, it's in 1.9.1 also.

The issue shows up when you need to sort results from a given IndexReader multiple times, using different locales. On line 180 (all line numbers from the 1.9.1 code), we have this:

ScoreDocComparator comparator = lookup (reader, fieldname, type, factory);

Then, if no comparator is found in the cache, a new one is created (line 193) and then stored in the cache (line 202). HOWEVER, both the cache lookup() and store() do NOT take into account locale; if we, on the same index reader, try to do one search sorted by Locale.FRENCH and one by Locale.ITALIAN, the first one will result in a cache miss, a new French comparator will be created, and stored in the cache. Second time through, lookup() finds the cached French comparator -- even though this time, the locale parameter to getCachedComparator() is an Italian locale. Therefore, we don't create a new comparator and we use the wrong one to sort the results.

It looks to me (unless I'm mistaken) that the FieldCacheImpl.Entry class should have an additional property, .locale, to ensure that different locales get different comparators.

Patch (well, most of one) to follow immediately."
1,"304 response status handlingI have an IBM WebSphere server that returns 304 responses with a Content-
Length header set to something other than 0 and the server is not closing the 
connection.  According to the HTTP RFC 
(http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.5):

""The 304 response MUST NOT contain a message-body, and thus is always 
terminated by the first empty line after the header fields.""

Obviously, the web server is returning a bad response but the HTTPClient 
blocks waiting on data in the response even though there shouldn't be any.  
Other HTTP clients (browsers) do not have this issue and seem to ignore the 
fact that the server set an invalid Content-Length in the response."
1,"Readers wrapping other readers don't prevent usage if any of their subreaders was closedOn recent trunk test we got this problem:
org.apache.lucene.index.TestReaderClosed.test
fails because the inner reader is closed but the wrapped outer ones are still open.

I fixed the issue partially for SlowCompositeReaderWrapper and ParallelAtomicReader but it failed again. The cool thing with this test is the following:

The test opens an DirectoryReader and then creates a searcher, closes the reader and executes a search. This is not an issue, if the reader is closed that the search is running on. This test uses LTC.newSearcher(wrap=true), which randomly wraps the passed Reader with SlowComposite or ParallelReader - or with both!!! If you then close the original inner reader, the close is not detected when excuting search. This can cause SIGSEGV when MMAP is used.

The problem in (in Slow* and Parallel*) is, that both have their own Fields instances thats are kept alive until the reader itsself is closed. If the child reader is closed, the wrapping reader does not know and still uses its own Fields instance that delegates to the inner readers. On this step no more ensureOpen checks are done, causing the failures.

The first fix done in Slow and Parallel was to call ensureOpen() on the subReader, too when requesting fields(). This works fine until you wrap two times: ParallelAtomicReader(SlowCompositeReaderWrapper(StandardDirectoryReader(segments_1:3:nrt _0(4.0):C42)))

One solution would be to make ensureOpen also check all subreaders, but that would do the volatile checks way too often (with n is the total number of subreaders and m is the number of hierarchical levels this is n^m) - we cannot do this. Currently we only have n*m which is fine.

The proposal how to solve this (closing subreaders under the hood of parent readers is to use the readerClosedListeners. Whenever a composite or slow reader wraps another readers, it registers itself as interested in readerClosed events. When a subreader is then forcefully closed (e.g by a programming error or this crazy test), we automatically close the parents, too.

We should also fix this in 3.x, if we have similar problems there (needs investigation)."

we had a similar problem with the query languages, but I solved that one
by telling the registry to use a specific classloader. this seemed to work.
I'm not sure this will also work for the text filters, because the jar

1,"disk full can cause index corruption in certain casesRobert uncovered this nasty bug, in adding more randomness to
oal.index tests...

I got a standalone test to show the issue; the corruption path is
as follows:

  * The merge hits an initial exception (eg disk full when merging the
    postings).

  * In handling this exception, IW closes all the sub-readers,
    suppressing any further exceptions.

  * If one of these sub-readers has pending deletions, which happens
    if readers are pooled in IW, it will flush them.  If that flush
    hits a 2nd exception (eg disk full), then SegmentReader
    [incorrectly] leaves the SegmentInfo's delGen advanced by 1,
    referencing a corrupt file, yet the SegmentReader is still
    forcefully closed.

  * If enough disk frees up such that a later IW.commit/close
    succeeds, the resulting segments file will reference an invalid
    deletions file.

1,"OOM erros with CheckIndex with indexes containg a lot of fields with normsAll index readers have a cache of the last used norms (SegmentReader, MultiReader, MultiSegmentReader,...). This cache is never cleaned up, so if you access norms of a field, the norm's byte[maxdoc()] array is not freed until you close/reopen the index.

You can see this problem, if you create an index with many fields with norms (I tested with about 4,000 fields) and many documents (half a million). If you then call CheckIndex, that calls norms() for each (!) field in the Segment and each of this calls creates a new cache entry, you get OutOfMemoryExceptions after short time (I tested with the above index: I was not able to do a CheckIndex even with ""-Xmx 16GB"" on 64bit Java).

CheckIndex opens and then tests each segment of a index with a separate SegmentReader. The big index with the OutOfMemory problem was optimized, so consisting of one segment with about half a million docs and about 4,000 fields. Each byte[] array takes about a half MiB for this index. The CheckIndex funtion created the norm for 4000 fields and the SegmentReader cached them, which is about 2 GiB RAM. So OOMs are not unusal.

In my opinion, the best would be to use a Weak- or better a SoftReference so norms.bytes gets java.lang.ref.SoftReference<byte[]> and used for caching. With proper synchronization (which is done on the norms cache in SegmentReader) you can do the best with SoftReference, as this reference is garbage collected only when an OOM may happen. If the byte[] array is freed (but it is only freed if no other references exist), a lter call to getNorms() creates a new array. When code is hard referencing the norms array, it will not be freed, so no problem. The same could be done for the other IndexReaders.

Fields without norm() do not have this problem, as all these fields share a one-time allocated dummy norm array. So the same index without norms enabled for most of the fields checked perfectly.

I will prepare a patch tomorrow.

Mike proposed another quick fix for CheckIndex:
bq. we could do something first specifically for CheckIndex (eg it could simply use the 3-arg non-caching bytes method instead) to prevent OOM errors when using it.

The reason is that new constructor forgets to initialize the stopSet field:
  public StandardAnalyzer(boolean replaceInvalidAcronym) {
    this.replaceInvalidAcronym = replaceInvalidAcronym;
  }

I guess this should be changed to something like this:
  public StandardAnalyzer(boolean replaceInvalidAcronym) {
    this(STOP_WORDS);
    this.replaceInvalidAcronym = replaceInvalidAcronym;
  }

The bug is present in RC3. Fix is one line, it'll be great to have it in 2.3
release.

    <li>some nested value = some description</li>

As it is illegal in HTML to nest a UL directly inside a UL, this method will always output unparseable HTML if there are nested explanations.

What Lucene probably means to output is the following, which is valid HTML:

ThaiAnalyzer uses StandardTokenizer, and this is really an issue with the grammar, which adds the entire [:Thai:] block to ALPHANUM.

i propose that alphanum be described a little bit differently in the grammar.
Instead, [:letter:] should be allowed to have diacritics/signs/combining marks attached to it.

this would allow the [:thai:] hack to be completely removed, would allow StandardTokenizer to parse complex writing systems such as Indian languages, and would fix LUCENE-1545.

1,"IndexWriter applies wrong deletes during concurrent flush-allYonik uncovered this with the TestRealTimeGet test: if a flush-all is
underway, it is possible for an incoming update to pick a DWPT that is
stale, ie, not yet pulled/marked for flushing, yet the DW has cutover
to a new deletes queue.  If this happens, and the deleted term was
also updated in one of the non-stale DWPTs, then the wrong document is
deleted and the test fails by detecting the wrong value.

There's a 2nd failure mode that I haven't figured out yet, whereby 2
docs are returned when searching by id (there should only ever be 1
doc since the test uses updateDocument which is atomic wrt
commit/reopen).

Yonik verified the test passes pre-DWPT, so my guess is (but I
have yet to verify) this test also passes on 3.x.  I'll backport
the test to 3.x to be sure.

I believe I tracked this down.  It is because NodeIdImpl is implicitly referencing its containing instance IdFactoryImpl which is not serializable.

I think I must be doing something wrong, because it seems like this is a fundamental problem with doing jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr, and looking at the SVN history I don't see how this ever could have worked.  
So either session.getRootNode() has never been tested using jcr2spi - rmi - spi2jcr, or I've got something setup wrong."
1,"Duplicate request headers when connect through proxiesWhen negotiating proxy servers or during write-failure retries, the httpClient 
adds duplicate request headers to each retry.  The result is that each header 
is duplicated multiple times (number of retries).  This only impact the headers 
that allow multiple values (the others were prevented byt the code).  In  
Particular, it affects ""cookie"" header.  It happens more often when going 
through proxy server with tunnelling connections (https), but also happens on 
http on NTLM proxy server (need multiple round trips to get authenticated).

Steps to Reproduce:
Setup a client application to go to a website that requires going through a 
proxy server that supports tunnelling for https connections and authenticate 
users (Basic and/or NTLM).  The website also need to support keep-alive and 
support https. Initilize the HttpState with a cookie. Turn httpClient 
logging ""wire, debug and trace"" logging on.  Set the proxy credential with 
valid user id and password.

Then run the application against any url on the website.

Test Results and fixes:
1. When connect to https through a (Netscape/Basic auth) proxy that does 
the ""tunnelling"", the initial ""CONNECT"" adds the cookie header once.  The proxy 
returns the 407.  Then the code will use the proxy credential to do 
the ""CONNECT"" again.  After successful connection (200), the code will do the 
proper ""POST"".  The httpClient code adds the same cookie one more time in here.

This case was caused by the wrapper class ConnectMethod using the wrapped 
method ""addRequestHeaders"" to build headers for the ""CONENCT"".  It can be fixed 
by having the ConnectMethod only adds headers it needs (""addHostRequestHeader"" 
and ""addProxyAuthorizationRequestHeader"").

2. When connect to http through proxy.  The client first sends a ""POST"" without 
proxy credentials, and gets a 407 back.  The cookie header is added before that 
happens.  Then (loop in the HttpMethodBase.execute) the client will retry 
the ""POST"" with the credentials (the logic require to have a response header to 
submit credentials).  In the retry, the cookie is added again 
(addRequestHeaders is called inside the writeRequest).

3. When using kee-alive with no-proxy on http, if the connection times out, the 
next call of the method will get a socket error on write.  The retry loop in 
the processRequest method will retry the request again.  It will add the cookie 
again.  To deal with both case 2 and 3, the addRequestHeadres call need to be 
moved up to the beginning of the HttpMethodBase.execute.  We tested this 
approach and it worked for us.

4. When negotiating NTLM proxy for https, multiple round trips are needed to 
get user authenticated.  The same ConnectMethod instance is used.  So the 
adding of the proxy authenticate headers need to be done with the ConnectMethod 
instance (vs. the wrapped method for Host header).  Otherwise, the 
Authenticator class would not be able to find the information for 
authenticating user.

1,"RegexQuery matches terms the input regex doesn't actually matchI was writing some unit tests for our own wrapper around the Lucene regex classes, and got tripped up by something interesting.

The regex ""cat."" will match ""cats"" but also anything with ""cat"" and 1+ following letters (e.g. ""cathy"", ""catcher"", ...)  It is as if there is an implicit .* always added to the end of the regex.

Here's a unit test for the behaviour I would expect myself:

    @Test
    public void testNecessity() throws Exception {
        File dir = new File(new File(System.getProperty(""java.io.tmpdir"")), ""index"");
        IndexWriter writer = new IndexWriter(dir, new StandardAnalyzer(), true);
        try {
            Document doc = new Document();
            doc.add(new Field(""field"", ""cat cats cathy"", Field.Store.YES, Field.Index.TOKENIZED));
            writer.addDocument(doc);
        } finally {
            writer.close();
        }

        IndexReader reader = IndexReader.open(dir);
        try {
            TermEnum terms = new RegexQuery(new Term(""field"", ""cat."")).getEnum(reader);

        } finally {
            reader.close();
        }
    }

This test fails on the term check with terms.term() equal to ""cathy"".

If you disk full event during flush, then DocumentsWriter will abort

1,"offset gap should be added regardless of existence of tokens in DocInverterPerFieldProblem: If a multiValued field which contains a stop word (e.g. ""will"" in the following sample) only value is analyzed by StopAnalyzer when indexing, the offsets of the subsequent tokens are not correct.

{code:title=indexing a multiValued field}
doc.add( new Field( F, ""Mike"", Store.YES, Index.ANALYZED, TermVector.WITH_OFFSETS ) );

In this program (soon to be attached), if you use WhitespaceAnalyzer, you'll get the offset(start,end) for ""use"" and ""Lucene"" will be use(10,13) and Lucene(14,20). But if you use StopAnalyzer, the offsets will be use(9,12) and lucene(13,19). When searching, since searcher cannot know what analyzer was used at indexing time, this problem causes out of alignment of FVH.

Cause of the problem: StopAnalyzer filters out ""will"", anyToken flag set to false then offset gap is not added in DocInverterPerField:

{code:title=DocInverterPerField.java}
if (anyToken)
  fieldState.offset += docState.analyzer.getOffsetGap(field);

1,"Inconsistency between Session.getProperty and Node.getProperty for binary valuesthere an inconsistency in the binary handling between the batch-reading facility and those cases where a property is directly
accessed without having accessed the parent node before.

this issue came up with timothee maret running into performance issues when retrieving the length of a binary property:

if the property-entry has been created in the run of a batch-read operation the corresponding property-data object
contains internal values that contain the length of the binary (such as transported with the json response) and only
read the data from the server if the value stream is explicitly requested.
however, if the property is accessed directly (e.g. Session.getProperty or Node.getProperty with a relative path) 
a GET request is made to the corresponding dav resource and the stream is read immediately.

possible solution:

if RepositoryService#getItemInfos(SessionInfo, ItemId) is called with a PropertyId the implementation
should not result in a GET request to the corresponding resource by calling super.getPropertyInfo(sessionInfo, (PropertyId) itemId).
instead it should be consistent with the batch-read and only make a PROPFIND request for the property
length. the returned PropertyInfo object would in that case be identical to the one generated by the batch-read functionality.

1,LuceneTestCase#newFSDirectoryImpl misses to set LockFactory if ctor call throws exceptionselckin reported on IRC that if you run ant test -Dtestcase=TestLockFactory -Dtestmethod=testNativeFSLockFactoryPrefix -Dtests.directory=FSDirectory the test fails. Since FSDirectory is an abstract class it can not be instantiated so our code falls back to FSDirector.open. yet we miss to set the given lockFactory though.
1,"Invalid cookie causing IllegalArgumentExceptionThe bug reported by Oliver KÃ¶ll <listen at quimby.de> on HttpClient mailing list

<quote>
I'm dealing with a site that serves invalid Cookies in various kind of  
ways. In some cases the Cookie values contain "","" characters, which  
really confuses the Header/Cookie parsers and eventually leads to  
IllegalArgumentExceptions thrown by the Cookie constructor:

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Cookie name may not be blank

What bothers me, is that these IllegalArgumentExceptions are never  
caught in the HttpClient code, making it effectivily impossible to  
handle these responses.

1,"SimpleFSLockFactory ignores error on deleting the lock fileSpinoff from here:

    http://www.gossamer-threads.com/lists/lucene/java-user/54438

The Lock.release for SimpleFSLockFactory ignores the return value of lockFile.delete().  I plan to throw a new LockReleaseFailedException, subclassing from IOException, when this returns false.  This is a very minor change to backwards compatibility because all methods in Lucene that release a lock already throw IOException."

the path is always encoded using URIUtil.encode(reqPath,URIUtil.pathSafe()).

1,"DictionaryCompoundWordTokenFilter does not properly add tokens from the end compound word.Due to an off-by-one error, a subword placed at the end of a compound word will not get a token added to the token stream.

Input: ""abcdef""
Created tokens: {""abcdef"", ""ab"", ""cd""}
Expected tokens: {""abcdef"", ""ab"", ""cd"", ""ef""}


Additionally, it could produce tokens that were shorter than the minSubwordSize due to another off-by-one error. For example (again, from the attached patch):

1,"ParallelReader fails on deletes and on seeks of previously unused fieldsIn using ParallelReader I've hit two bugs:

1.  ParallelReader.doDelete() and doUndeleteAll() call doDelete() and doUndeleteAll() on the subreaders, but these methods do not set hasChanges.  Thus the changes are lost when the readers are closed.  The fix is to call deleteDocument() and undeleteAll() on the subreaders instead.

2.  ParallelReader discovers the fields in each subindex by using IndexReader.getFieldNames() which only finds fields that have occurred on at least one document.  In general a parallel index is designed with assignments of fields to sub-indexes and term seeks (including searches) may be done on any of those fields, even if no documents in a particular state of the index have yet had an assigned field.  Seeks/searches on fields that have not yet been indexed generated an NPE in ParallelReader's various inner class seek() and next() methods because fieldToReader.get() returns null on the unseen field.  The fix is to extend the add() methods to supply the correct list of fields for each subindex.

Patch that corrects both of these issues attached.

1,"NumericUtils.floatToSortableInt/doubleToSortableLong does not sort certain NaN ranges correctly and NumericRangeQuery produces wrong results for NaNs with half-open rangesThe current implementation of floatToSortableInt does not account for different NaN ranges which may result in NaNs sorted before -Infinity and after +Infinity. The default Java ordering is: all NaNs after Infinity.

A possible fix is to make all NaNs canonic ""quiet NaN"" as in:
{code}
// Canonicalize NaN ranges. I assume this check will be faster here than 
// (v == v) == false on the FPU? We don't distinguish between different
// flavors of NaNs here (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NaN). I guess
// in Java this doesn't matter much anyway.
if ((v & 0x7fffffff) > 0x7f800000) {
  // Apply the logic below to a canonical ""quiet NaN""
  return 0x7fc00000 ^ 0x80000000;
}
{code}

I don't commit because I don't know how much of the existing stuff relies on this (nobody should be keeping different NaNs  in their indexes, but who knows...)."

1,"Invalid query results when using jcr:like with a case transform function and a pattern not starting with a wildcardIf the repository contains nodes with the following value for the property name :
john
JOhn
joe
Joey

and we run the following query :
//element(*, document)/*[jcr:like(fn:lower-case(@name), 'joh%')]"")
then all the previous nodes will match especially the last 2 nodes.

The reason is the use of two range scans from the lucene term index:
..._name_jOH
..................
..._name_joh_

and

..._name_JOH
..................
..._name_Joh_

The first range will contains ..._name_joe property and the second will contains ..._name_Joey.
But the pattern 'joh%' and so the regexp '.*' because of the range scan will match
the substring values of the properties ('' in the first range and 'y' in the second range).

The solution is to use the full pattern (ie 'joh.*') for matching each properties."

1,"NTLM authentication failed due to closing of connectionDescription:

When dealing with a NTLM proxy server that sends response back with lines:

14:51:27:750 << HTTP/1.0 407 Proxy Authentication Required
14:51:27:796 << Date: Mon, 14 Apr 2003 19:52:43GMT[\r][\n]
14:51:27:796 << Content-Length: 257[\r][\n]

14:51:27:796 << Proxy-Authenticate: NTLM 
TlRMTVNTUAACAAAABgAGACgAAAAGggEAtOoNy4M0g0EAAAAAAAAAAEdMT0JBTA==[\r][\n]

The httpClient code is using the ""HTTP/1.0"" as clue for closing the connection 
and ignored the ""Connection: keep-alive"".  That caused the NTLM authentication 
to fail as the NTLM requires the response to the challenge to be sent back on 
the same connection.

Proposed Fix:

Our fix is to add a flag inProxyAuthenticationRetry (in HttpMethodBase) to 
indicate that the method is doing proxy authentication retry.  When the flag is 
true, in ""HttpMethodBase.shouldCloseConnection"", check the ""Connection: keep-
alive"" before determining to close the connection."

so a very large product would first overflow MAX_INT, become negative, and only then (auto) casted to long, but this is too late.

both rhs are longs while lhs is int.

1,"BooleanFilter changed behavior in 3.5, no longer acts as if ""minimum should match"" set to 1The change LUCENE-3446 causes a change in behavior in BooleanFilter. It used to work as if minimum should match clauses is 1 (compared to BQ lingo), but now, if no should clauses match, then the should clauses are ignored, and for example, if there is a must clause, only that one will be used and returned.

For example, a single must clause and should clause, with the should clause not matching anything, should not match anything, but, it will match whatever the must clause matches.

The fix is simple, after iterating over the should clauses, if the aggregated bitset is null, return null."

1,"Jackrabbit fails to shutdown properly when tomcat is shutting downThis is the same issue already discudded in http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/JCR-57

The problem only occurs when Jackrabbit is deployed in the WEB-INF/lib directory of a web application in Tomcat.
During dispose() jackrabbit tries to instantiate a few objects from classes which were not previously loaded by the webapp classloader, but tomcat doesn't allow to load new classes while shutting down.
This causes the repository not to be closed properly, and an annoying set of stack traces are written to the log.

It seems that there are only two classes which are loaded in this situation: org.apache.jackrabbit.core.observation.EventListenerIteratorImpl and org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.FileSystemPathUtil. This is the log from the server standard output:

org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader loadClass
INFO: Illegal access: this web application instance has been stopped already.  Could not load org.apache.jackrabbit.core.observation.EventListenerIteratorImpl.  The eventual following stack trace is caused by an error thrown for debugging purposes as well as to attempt to terminate the thread which caused the illegal access, and has no functional impact.
[repeaded more times at each shutdown]

org.apache.catalina.loader.WebappClassLoader loadClass
INFO: Illegal access: this web application instance has been stopped already.  Could not load org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.FileSystemPathUtil.  The eventual following stack trace is caused by an error thrown for debugging purposes as well as to attempt to terminate the thread which caused the illegal access, and has no functional impact.


A quick fix is to force preloading of classes normally needed only during shutdown, simply adding a static block to caller classes. The following patch makes tomcat happy, causing classes to be loaded by the webapp classloaded when still allowed  (probably not really elegant, but perfectly working...)

1,"JNDI data sources with various PersistenceManager: wrong default valuesWith JCR-1305 Jackrabbit supports creating a connection throug a JNDI Datasource and without configuring user and password. This works for some but not all provided PersistenceManagers. Some of them - like the Oracle-specific BundleDBPersistenceManager - sets default values for user and password if none are provided in the jackrabbit config. This way its impossible to use such PersistenceManagers with the plain JNDI DS.

This concerns the following BundleDbPersistenceManagers: OraclePersistenceManager, DerbyPersistenceManager, H2PersistenceManager.

There also might be other PMs (perhaps some special SimpleDbPersistenceManagers) with similar behaviour."

1,"search.jsp doesn't handle utf-8 parameters correctly
1.  I  cannot use WebDav client to uploaded a file whose name is in Chinese.  The file name I had is ''郭可为.txt'  and the uploaded command by the WebDav client did something like:

  ========= Outbound Message =========
PUT /op/%ED%EF%3A.txt HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
-----

 The server didn't decode it correctly -- the result is the file name got screwed and the file content was not uploaded.

2. In the default web.war module,  there is search.jsp for rendering the search page. If I type Chinese text in the search box,  search.jsp does not decode the input parameter from ISO-8859-1 to utf-8 and in turn the search engine searches wrong string.

3. The search engine does do search correctly if I hardcode the query  variable in search.jsp or do decoding the query parameter from ISO-885901 to utf-8.

Similarly, the same session will not be able to modify that item B - e.g. add a child node in case it was a node - since implementation e.g. checks of that

1,"UUID compareTo and hashCodeThe current UUID.compareTo implementation is not correct. Usually, 'equals' is used so this is not a big problem, but I need to create an ordered list of UUIDs and for this I need compareTo. The current implementation is based on subtraction, but this doesn't always work. Example:

//long a = 10, b = 20, c = 0;
long a = Long.MAX_VALUE, b = Long.MIN_VALUE, c = 0;
System.out.println((a - b) < 0 ? ""a < b"" : ""a >= b"");
System.out.println((c - a) < 0 ? ""c < a"" : ""c >= a"");
System.out.println((b - c) < 0 ? ""b < c"" : ""b >= c"");

The hashCode implementation is OK, but the multiplication is not required."

Server is default jcr server (jackrabbit-webapp-1.3.1 on tomcat),

I've noticed that Node.getProperty returns only cached properties. 

Sample test case can be found at http://kplab.tuke.sk/svn/kplab/ctm/trunk/test/org/kplab/tsf/CTMTest.java

Note that sometimes properties do get printed, so it may not be so straightforwarding to reproduce this bug.


Simple Example:

// I have nt:file node at kplab/jojo in my repository
...
Session session = repository.login();
Node root  = session.getRootNode();
Node node = root.getNode(""kplab/jojo"");
// node.getProperty(""jcr:content/jcr:data""); // force to load property
from server
dump(node); // simple dump method from (
http://jackrabbit.apache.org/doc/firststeps.html )


dump prints:
/kplab/jojo
/kplab/jojo/jcr:content

But when I uncomment the getProperty line above, it prints:

1,"ItemStateMap warnings during node type changesAs reported already in JCR-1105, the ItemStateMap logs warnings when a cached item state is being overwritten. This shouldn't normally happen, but it turns out that virtual item state providers do this when the root of the virtual tree is modified. Probably the most common such situation is when node types are being modified. This case is luckily not troublesome for the virtual tree functionality, but the logged warnings are annoying.

If a class descriptor (for whatever reason) does not have a jcr type, a npe is thrown in ClassDescriptor.

The Payloads unit test doesn't catch this. Now that we have the new
DocumentsWriter we buffer much more docs by default then before. This means
that the test cases can't assume anymore that the DocsWriter flushes after 10
docs by default. TestPayloads however falsely assumed this, which means that no
merges happen anymore in TestPayloads. We should check whether there are
other testcases that rely on this.

The fixes for TestPayloads and SegmentMerger are very simple, I'll attach a patch

I've seen this problem with other .ca domains so this isn't a problem unique to
amazon.ca.

My guess would be that the problem is on line 929 of Cookie.java:

int domainParts = new StringTokenizer(cookie.getDomain(), ""."").countTokens();

Where domainParts would be 2 for a domain like "".amazon.ca"" instead of the 3
that the code is expecting.  I'm not that familiar with the cookie spec so I
could be completely wrong ;-)

1,"MatchAllScorer calculateDocFilter() bugIn MatchAllScorer.calculateDocFilter(), When you have just two nodes, with different properties, like ""myprop"" and ""myprop2"", and you have an xpath String xpath = ""//*[@myprop], you get both nodes back (to be precise, you'll get every node that has a property that startswith ""myprop"")


You can reproduce it by changing the SimpleQueryTest.testIsNotNull() a little:

Change 

bar.setProperty(""text"", ""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.""); 

to

bar.setProperty(""mytextwhichstartswithmytext"", ""the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog."");

Now the test with xpath = ""//*[@jcr:primaryType='nt:unstructured' and @mytext]""; fails because 2 results. I did test for the trunk and tag 1.3.1 and both have the same problem. I have attached MatchAllScorer.java.patch in this mail, or should I create a JIRA issue for this? 

Furthermore I would like to discuss a different implementation for the MatchAllScorer, because IMHO the current calculateDocFilter() becomes slow pretty fast (see bottom email the code part i am referring to: if you have 100.000 docs with ""mytext"" property, and you query  [@mytext] the loop below is executed at least 100.000 times). I think it might be out of scope for the user-list, or is the user-list the place to discuss something like this?

1,"QueryImpl result offSet must be considered after security class grant the item.ackrabbit version is 1.4 (jackrabbit-core - 1.4.5).
I use searches with result limit and offset but it is working some wrong for my case.
Lets suppose the total of nodes that will return with the search:

NAME      - GRANTACCESS -   OFFSET
node1     -     true                    - 0
node2     -     false                  -  1
node3     -     true                    - 2
node4     -     true                    - 3
node5     -     false                  -  4

My page must have 2 records, so first I do a count for the search and get size of 3 records (after filtered by my security class invoked automatically by jackrabbit), so I have 2 pages to show to the user. The first page must return 2 records, of course, and the second must return 1 record.

In the first search I do set:
QueryImp.setOffset(0);
QueryImpl.setLimit(2);

So, I get the nodes 1 and 3, thats correct.

In the second same search (for second page), I do set:
QueryImp.setOffset(2);
QueryImpl.setLimit(2);

This way I pretend to get two records, starting from the record nro 3, which would be only the node4.
But, the result I got is node3 (again) and node4, because the offset worked not according to the grantacess (provided by the security class), but according to the sequence of the raw result.

This offset have to start in the correct position, counting only the granted nodes returned by the security class.
Hope this make sense for you.

Thanks.

1,"AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget does not recognize target host correctlyI am trying to execute an HttpGet with the following URI:
""http://www.foo.foo/doSomething.html?url=http://www.bar.bar/doSomethingElse.html""

This leads to UnknownHostException

Going through the internal code, the problem seems to be in the AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget method:
            String ssp = requestURI.getSchemeSpecificPart();
            ssp = ssp.substring(2, ssp.length()); //remove ""//"" prefix
            int end = ssp.indexOf(':') > 0 ? ssp.indexOf(':') :
                    ssp.indexOf('/') > 0 ? ssp.indexOf('/') :
                    ssp.indexOf('?') > 0 ? ssp.indexOf('?') : ssp.length();
            String host = ssp.substring(0, end);

This code sets the target host to ""www.foo.foo/doSomething.html?url=http"" instead of ""www.foo.foo"". This obviously breaks the execution not far down the line... DefaultClientConnectionOperator.resolveHostname throws an UnknownHostException.

FWIW the AbstractHttpClient.determineTarget method actually has access to the request URI object, which correctly states that the host is ""www.foo.foo"".

So why does it try to extract the host from the scheme specific part anyway?

I hope this is useful... and if there is any workaround please let me know, as I'm stuck on this one.

1,"Error on query initialization - intermittentAbout 1 in ten times, I get the error as shown in the stack trace below. This happens when I run test, or when I start the app. The only way to resolve (when testing) seems to be to blow away the repository. 

It always happens at the point the query manager is accessed (triggering the query subsystem to start up). It DOES NOT cause an exception to be thrown back to the caller, I just noticed it in the logs. Basically the queries return NO data at all (and show up as test failures of course). 

In each case when I startup the system/test, if the repository exists I use it, and (for tests) clean it by deleting the root node of the user content, and then starting again, otherwise there is nothing that exciting.

Please let me know if more info is needed.

1,"Possible rare thread hazard in IW.commitI was seeing a very rare intermittent failure in TestIndexWriter.testCommitThreadSafety.

The issue happens if one thread calls commit while another is flushing, and is exacerbated at high flush rates (eg maxBufferedDocs=2).  The thread doing commit will first flush, and then it syncs the files.  However in between those two, if other threads manage to add enough docs and trigger another flush, a 2nd new segment can sneak into the SegmentInfos before we sync.

This is normally harmless, in that it just means the commit includes a few more docs that had been added by other threads, so it's fine. But, it can mean that a committed segment references the still-open doc store files.  Our tests now catch this (I changed MockDirWrapper to throw an exception in this case), and so testCommitThreadSafety can fail with this exception.  If you hardwire the maxBufferedDocs to 2 it happens quite often.

It's not clear this is really a problem in real apps vs just our anal MockDirWrapper but I think we should fix it..."

1,"IdleConnectionHandler can leave closed connections in a inconsistent stateIdleConnectionHandler when shutting down 'stale' connection does not update the state of AbstractPoolEntry thus causing an inconsistency between the state of the connection (closed) and that of the pool entry (still assumed open). The problem is mitigated by the fact that the pooling manager usually evicts closed connections almost immediately. There is a small window of time in the ThreadSafeClientConnManager#closeIdleConnection method, at which a connection can be closed by the IdleConnectionHandler and immediately leased from the pool by another thread in an inconsistent state before the main thread gets a chance to re-acquire the pool lock and clean out closed connections.

For 4.0.x the problem can be worked around by retaining the pool lock for the entire span of the #closeIdleConnection. For the 4.1 branch a better solution should be devised. This probably means a complete rewrite or deprecation of IdleConnectionHandler."

note that the msg of the exception is misleading: the above code did never try to remove
the root node. 

the exception is caused by a bug in CachingHierarchyManager which fails to update
the cache correctly.

btw: if you comment the first logging stmt, i.e. 

                //System.out.println(""added "" + a.getPath());

the problem doesn't occur anymore."
1,"PdfTextFilter may leave parsed document open in case of errorsIn case of errors in a parsed PDF document jackrabbit may fail to properly close the parsed document. PDFBox will write a stack trace to system out at finalize to warn agains this.

this is the resulting log:

this may happens because the parse() method at

parser = new PDFParser(new BufferedInputStream(in));
parser.parse();

immediately creates a document, but it can throw an exception while processing the file.
PdfTextFilter should check if parser still holds a document and close it appropriately.

1,"WriteLineDocTask incorrectly normalizes fieldsWriteLineDocTask normalizes the body, title and date fields by replacing any ""\t"" with a space. However, if any one of them contains newlines, LineDocMaker will fail, since the first line read will include some of the text, however the second line, which it now expects to be a new document, will include other parts of the text.

I don't know how we didn't hit it so far. Maybe the wikipedia text doesn't have such lines, however when I ran over the TREC collection I hit a lot of those.

I will attach a patch shortly."
1,"MultipartPost closes input streamThis is something of a collection of issues that are all interrelated.

1. MultipartPost calls close on the outputstream it retrieved from 
HttpConnection which causes an exception to be thrown later on.  This call 
should be replaced with a call to flush().

2. The MultipartPost classes do not have any logging in them.  We should add 
trace statements at a minimum.

3. new FilePart(String, File) throws a null pointer exception.

4. The tests in TestPartsNoHost are broken.

I'll attach patches for these fixes in a moment, broken down as much as 
possible."
1,"CookieSpecBase.domainMatch() leaks cookies to 3rd party domainsThe change committed for #32833
<http://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=32833> is buggy; it doesn't
match browser behavior and in fact leaks cookies to third party domains. 

To see, try the following:

CookieSpecBase cspec = new CookieSpecBase();
Cookie cookie = new Cookie("".hotmail.com"",""foo"",""bar"",""/"",Integer.MAX_VALUE,false);
cspec.match(""iwanttostealcookiesfromhotmail.com"",80,""/"",false,cookie);

It will return true. Testing in Firefox1.0.4 and IE6 show no such similar
leakage for similar cases. (Indeed, it'd be a headline-making privacy bug if
they were to do this.)

Those browsers do, in my limited testing, behave as desired by the filer of
#32833: a cookie of domain value '.mydomain.com' will be returned to exact host
'mydomain.com' (. However, the fix that was suggested was overbroad.

I suggest instead for CookieSpecBase.domainMatch():

    public boolean domainMatch(final String host, final String domain) {
// BUGGY: matches a '.service.com' cookie to hosts like 'enemyofservice.com'
//        return host.endsWith(domain)
//            || (domain.startsWith(""."") && host.endsWith(domain.substring(1)));
// BETTER: RFC2109, plus matches a '.service.com' cookie to exact host 'service.com'
        return host.equals(domain)
            || (domain.startsWith(""."") 
                    && (host.endsWith(domain)
                            || host.equals(domain.substring(1))));

1,"CachingHttpClient returns a 411 respones when executing a POST (HttpPost) request The CachingHttpClient validates requests prior executing them, by calling RequestProtocolCompliance.requestIsFatallyNonCompliant(..).

When executing an HttpPost, this method considers the request is invalid because it does not contain (yet) a content-length header. Indeed, I observed that this header is generated at the time the DefaultHttpClient fires the request.

NB: i'm using the Cache 4.1-alpha2 plugged over the HttpClient 4.0.1-final. I can't use the latest version for both because I need to rely on a stable version if there's any. I would be curious to know if we get the same behaviour in 4.1...

Anyway, I would see two fixes for that issue:
- make HttpPost set the content-length at the time the entity is set,
- or remove the validation step on the CachingHttpClient side.

1,NPE in ConsolidatingChangeLog for id base NodeIdConsolidatingChangeLog does not guard guard against null in the path value of a NodeId. 
1,"Suggested Patches to MultiPhraseQuery and QueryTermExtractor (for use with HighLighter)I encountered a problem with the Highlighter, where it was not recognizing MultiPhraseQuery.
To fix this, I developed the following two patches:

=====================================================
1. Addition to org.apache.lucene.search.MultiPhraseQuery:

Add the following method:

/** Returns the set of terms in this phrase. */
public Term[] getTerms() {
  ArrayList allTerms = new ArrayList();
  Iterator iterator = termArrays.iterator();
  while (iterator.hasNext()) {
    Term[] terms = (Term[])iterator.next();
    for (int i = 0, n = terms.length; i < n; ++i) {
      allTerms.add(terms[i]);
    }
  }
  return (Term[])allTerms.toArray(new Term[0]);
}

=====================================================
2. Patch to org.apache.lucene.search.highlight.QueryTermExtractor:

a) Add the following import:
import org.apache.lucene.search.MultiPhraseQuery;

b) Add the following code to the end of the getTerms(...) method:
      else  if(query instanceof MultiPhraseQuery)
              getTermsFromMultiPhraseQuery((MultiPhraseQuery) query, terms, fieldName);
  }

c) Add the following method:
 private static final void getTermsFromMultiPhraseQuery(MultiPhraseQuery query, HashSet terms, String fieldName)
 {
   Term[] queryTerms = query.getTerms();
   int i;

   for (i = 0; i < queryTerms.length; i++)
   {
       if((fieldName==null)||(queryTerms[i].field()==fieldName))
       {
           terms.add(new WeightedTerm(query.getBoost(),queryTerms[i].text()));
       }
   }
 }


=====================================================

Can the team update the repository?

Thanks

1,"Group#getMembers may list inherited members multiple timesi just happen to detect the following regression that seems to be introduces quite a while ago:

Group#getMembers is defined to return all group members including those inherited by another group being member of that group.

Example:
User t
Group a : t is declared member
Group b : t is declared member
Group c : a, b are declared members

The expected result of Group.getMembers was: a, b and t.

What is currently happening is that t is included twice in the returned iterator.
Quickly testing on jackrabbit 2.0 revealed that this used to work before...

I didn't carefully check when that bug has been introduced but the the refactoring of the membership
collections seems to be a possible culprit.

1,"Node.getPath() will corrupt the sessionWhen calling Node.getPath() anytime, no mather if its before or after save, and when deleting nodes, the internal reference points to the wrong nodes. 
The attached test will always fail with a javax.jcr.RepositoryException: /: cannot remove root node. 
We have seen other configurations where a node suddenly behaves as the another node that has references and throw a reference exception, and yet other configurations where the node we though we deleted still exists, and another node has now disappeared.

I do not know what causes the bug,a good bet is perhaps the CachingHierarchyManager?. It was not present in Jackrabbit 1.0.1, but was introduced in 1.1.

Have also tested the latest release: 1.2.2, and the bug is still present there.

1,"Session.import() failes to resolve propert property definition in some casesSome Properties get assigned the wrong definiton when imported via SysView XML.

The selecteion of the definition failes under the following condition:
The nodetype contains a multi-valued property and a single-valued
residual property.
If the data to be imported than contains only one value for the multivalued property, it will be created with the residual definition.
A later access to this propertie's values will fail with an ValueFormatException.

Example:
Node-Type

  - name: myapp:name
  - mulitple: true
 - Property
  - name: *
  - multible: false

1,"jcr2spi NodeEntryImpl.getPath() blows stack due to getIndex() calling itselfThe jcr2spi NodeEntryImpl class contains logic that causes getIndex() to call itself.

Calling code:

    Session sess = repo.login(creds);
    Node inboxNode = sess.getRootNode().getNode(""Inbox"");
    inboxNode.getPath(); <== blows stack

Tracing reveals:

    1. NodeEntryImpl.getPath() ultimately calls getIndex()
    2. getIndex() calls NodeState.getDefinition()
    3. which calls ItemDefinitionProviderImpl.getQNodeDefinition(...)
    4. which catches a RepositoryException then calls NodeEntryImpl.getWorkspaceId()
    5. which calls NodeEntryImpl.getWorkspaceIndex()
    6. which calls getIndex() (back to step 2, ad infinitum)

Configuration:
    1. A configuration is loaded specifying in-memory persist manager
    2. Config is wrapped in TransientRepository
    3. that's wrapped in spi2jcr's RepositoryService using default BatchReadConfig
    4. a jcr2spi provider is instantiated that directly couples to spi2jcr
    5. Node in question is created as follows:

    Session sess = repo.login(creds);
    sess.getRootNode().addNode(""Inbox"", ""nt:folder"");
    sess.save();

1,"CMS fails to cleanly stop threadsWhen you close IW, it waits for (or aborts and then waits for) all running merges.

However, it's wait criteria is wrong -- it waits for the threads to be done w/ their merges, not for the threads to actually die.

CMS already has a sync() method, to wait for running threads, which we can call from CMS.close.  However it has a thread hazard because a MergeThread removes itself from mergeThreads before it actually exits.  So sync() is able to return even while a merge thread is still running.

This was uncovered by LUCENE-2819 on the test case TestCustomScoreQuery.testCustomExternalQuery, though I expect other test cases would show it."

- The previous fragment may be very short, but if it contains a hit it will be combined with the new fragment later so this disappears.
- If the token is close to a natural fragment boundary the new fragment will end up very short; possibly even as short as just the span or phrase itself. This is the result of creating a new fragment without incrementing currentNumFrags.

1,"Trouble undeploying jackrabbit-webapp from TomcatWhen testing jackrabbit-webapp for the 1.4 release, I again came across this issue that I've occasionally seen also before, but never qualified enough for a bug report.

The Jackrabbit webapp would deploy without problems, but when I undeploy the webapp Tomcat fails to remove the Derby jar in WEB-INF/lib (I have unpackWARs enabled). This causes problems especially when I have autoDeploy enabled, as Tomcat then deploys the skeleton webapp right after undeployment, and the only way to really get rid of the webapp is to shutdown Tomcat and to manually remove the webapp on the file system.

I suspect that this problem is related to Derby jar being somehow referenced even after the webapp is undeployed, causing Windows to prevent the jar file from being removed.

Unless someone has some bright idea on how to resolve this, I'll consider this a known issue in Jackrabbit 1.4."
1,"Cluster: Node type register/unregister deadlockA deadlock can occur when two cluster nodes concurrently register or unregister node types.

Reason: 

NodeTypeRegistry.registerNodeTypes is synchronized, and calls eventChannel.registered(ntDefs), which calls AbstractJournal.lockAndSync(), which tries to lock AbstractJournal.rwLock.

On the other hand, AbstractJournal.sync() locks AbstractJournal.rwLock, then calls NodeTypeRecord.process, which calls NodeTypeRegistry.unregisterNodeTypes, which is also synchronized.

Possible solutions: Either 

- NodeTypeRegistry doesn't synchronize on the object when calling a eventChannel method,

- or NodeTypeRegistry locks AbstractJournal.rwLock before synchronizing.

There might be other solutions."

1,"problems with IR's readerFinishedListenerThere are two major problems:
1. The listener api does not really apply all indexreaders. for example segmentreaders dont fire it on close, only segmentcorereaders. this is wrong, a segmentcorereader is *not* an indexreader. Furthermore, if you register it on a top-level reader you get events for anything under the reader tree (sometimes, unless they are segmentreaders as mentioned above, where it doesnt work correctly at all).
2. Furthermore your listener is 'passed along' in a viral fashion from clone() and reopen(). This means for example, if you are trying to listen to readers in NRT search you are just accumulating reader listeners, all potentially keeping references to old indexreaders (because, in order to deal with #1 your listener must 'keep' a reference to the IR it was registered on, so it can check if thats *really* the one).

We should discuss how to fix #1. 

I will create a patch for #2 shortly and commit it, its just plain wrong.

1,"httpClient failed to reconnect after keep-alive connection timed outDescription:

When using httpClient with https tunnelling througha proxy server, after keep-
alive connection timed out on server side.  The httpClient code was unable to 
establish the connection again.

Cause:

The HttpMethodBase.processRequest's retry loop retries the connection without 
going through the ""CONNECT"" request to the proxy server.  Our proxy server 
returns 407 error code.  In case of tunnelling connection, proper reconnect 
should be done by first doing the ""CONNECT"" sequence to get authenticated 
throught the proxy.

Temp fix and Work around:

We implemented some work around to do the retry from the application layer.  In 
order to detect the situation, we have to rely on the error message contained 
in the HttpRecoverableException.  We are checking the text ""Connection aborted 
by peer: socket write error"".  We also have to modify the HttpMethodBase code 
to throw the HttpRecoverableException out to the application."

we have got a NullPointerException in the Lucene-class CompoundFileReader:

        at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.close(IndexWriter.java:236)

Lucene has been working fine for some days, until this NullPointerException
has occured which has corrupted the complete index.

The reason for this NullPointerException is the following Code 
in Lucenes source file CompoundFileReader.java:

    public CompoundFileReader(Directory dir, String name)
    throws IOException
    {
        boolean success = false;
        ...

        try {
            stream = dir.openFile(name);

            // read the directory and init files
            ...

            success = true;

        } finally {
            if (! success) {
                try {
                    stream.close();
                } catch (IOException e) { }
            }
        }
    }

If the IO-method-call ""dir.openFile()"" throws an IOExeption,
then the variable ""stream"" remains its null value.
The statement ""stream.close()"" in the finally clause will then cause a
NullPointerException.

I would suggest that you change the code from:
    stream.close();
to:
    if ( stream != null ) {
        stream.close();
    }

There are a lot of reasons why an IO-operation like ""dir.openFile()""
could throw an IOException.
I cannot guarantee that such an IO exception will never occur again.
Therefore it is better to handle such an IO exception correctly.

This issue is similar to bug# 29774, except that I recommand an easy way
to solve this problem."

We are using a query with 'AND' like 'bla AND blo' on 5 fields.
One of the fields has a Tokenizer which returns no token
at all on this query, and this together with the AND
triggers the exception."
1,"If you ""flush by RAM usage"" then IndexWriter may over-mergeI think a good way to maximize performance of Lucene's indexing for a
given amount of RAM is to flush (writer.flush()) the added documents
whenever the RAM usage (writer.ramSizeInBytes()) has crossed the max
RAM you can afford.

But, this can confuse the merge policy and cause over-merging, unless
you set maxBufferedDocs properly.

This is because the merge policy looks at the current maxBufferedDocs
to figure out which segments are level 0 (first flushed) or level 1
(merged from <mergeFactor> level 0 segments).

I'm not sure how to fix this.  Maybe we can look at net size (bytes)
of a segment and ""infer"" level from this?  Still we would have to be
resilient to the application suddenly increasing the RAM allowed.

The good news is to workaround this bug I think you just need to
ensure that your maxBufferedDocs is less than mergeFactor *
typical-number-of-docs-flushed.

1,"Optimize runs forever if you keep deleting docs at the same timeBecause we ""cascade"" merges for an optimize... if you also delete documents while the merges are running, then the merge policy will see the resulting single segment as still not optimized (since it has pending deletes) and do a single-segment merge, and will repeat indefinitely (as long as your app keeps deleting docs)."
1,"finalize()-methods of FSDirectory.FSIndexInput and FSDirectory.FSIndexOutput try to close already closed fileHi all,

I found a small problem in FSDirectory: The finalize()-methods of FSDirectory.FSIndexInput and FSDirectory.FSIndexOutput try to close the underlying file. This is not a problem unless the file has been closed before by calling the close() method. If it has been closed before, the finalize method throws an IOException saying that the file is already closed. Usually this IOException would go unnoticed, because the GarbageCollector, which calls finalize(), just eats it. However, if I use the Eclipse debugger the execution of my code will always be suspended when this exception is thrown.

Even though this exception probably won't cause problems during normal execution of Lucene, the code becomes cleaner if we apply this small patch. Might this IOException also have a performance impact, if it is thrown very frequently?

I attached the patch which applies cleanly on the current svn HEAD. All testcases pass and I verfied with the Eclipse debugger that the IOException is not longer thrown."

The query dump is made at QueryImpl.execute (line 136)

The constant PADDING is a 255 character array, but in my program it would need it to be bigger.
I think putting it to 65535 would not be a problem : it would only take a little bit more memory.

Two causes for this exception have been identified:

 (Taken from an email to the dev-list from Marcel Reutegger):
> - session A reads some items I
> - session B transiently removes items in I
> - session A logs out and starts to iterate over I in  LocalItemStateManager (LISM)
> - session B saves changes and removed items are evicted from A's LISM
> - session A gets concurrent modification exception

Another scenario is the following:
- Session A gets the iterator of the values of (the primary cache of) an ItemStateReferenceCache in LocalItemStateManager.dispose.
- Session B then does something that triggers the CacheManager.
- The CacheManager then calls resizeAll, and evicts some items from the secondary cache of the ItemStateReferenceCache of which the LocalItemStateManager has a values iterator.
- The garbage collector then runs and evicts the removed items also from the primary cache, which effectively modifies the set over which is iterated.

1,"MultipartPostMethod Holding File Stream Open?From: ""Daniel Walsh"" <daniel.walsh13@verizon.net>
Date: Tue Feb 25, 2003  8:05:49 PM US/Eastern
To: ""Commons HttpClient Project"" <commons-httpclient-dev@jakarta.apache.org>
Subject: MultipartPostMethod Holding File Stream Open?
Reply-To: ""Commons HttpClient Project"" <commons-httpclient-dev@jakarta.apache.org>

I'm using a MultipartPostMethod to upload a file to a servlet:

File file = new File(strUrl);

HttpClient client = new HttpClient();
HostConfiguration hostConfig = new HostConfiguration();
MultipartPostMethod mpPost = new MultipartPostMethod();

 hostConfig.setHost(someURL.getHost(), someURL.getPort(), someURL.getProtocol());
client.setConnectionTimeout(30000);
client.setHostConfiguration(hostConfig);

mpPost.addParameter(""someName"", ""someValue"");
mpPost.addParameter(file.getName(), file);

mpPost.setPath(strPath);
client.executeMethod(mpPost);

String confirmUpload = tpPost.getResponseBodyAsString();
mpPost.releaseConnection();

file.delete();  // this is being blocked.

After the upload, I would like to delete the file off of my disk.  Using other
methods of uploading the file (in particular a PutMethod), I was able to then
delete the file after the upload.  Now that I am using the MultipartPostMethod
obj for the upload, I am unable to delete the file (the return value is false,
and there is no SecurityException being thrown - no SecurityManager even set as
of this point either).

So, I guess my question is whether there is a call to the MultipartPostMethod
obj that I'm overlooking that would release it's connection (I'm sure that it is
opening an InputStream of some sort to read the file contents, in order to form
the HTTP message) to the file - so that I can then have unimpeded access to it
for other operations?"

1,"Stale connection check does not work with IBM JSSE/JREOS: Windows/AIX
JRE: IBM JRE 1.4.1
JSSE: IBM's implementation (SSLite?)
HttpClient Library: 2.0.2 release

My code enabled connection pooling feature to gain performance improvement in 
the SSL Handshake area. The code works perfectly on Sun JRE 1.4.2 with a think 
time of 60seconds between requests, but the same code fails on IBM JRE. On IBM 
JRE, the code fails to detech stale connections, thus causing down the stream 
setSoTimeout() call to fail.

Further debugging into the library code revealed difference in the way the 
HTTPConnection.isStale() behaves. With in that method, particularly, the 
inputStream.isAvailable() method returns 0 with Sun JRE but -1 with IBM JRE.

I made a small code change to HttpConnection.isStale() method by moving the try
{}finally{} block outside of the if(inputStream.isAvailable()==0) check in the 
following code and BINGO, everything started working on IBM JVMs. It did not 
break anything on Suns JVM.

For example, if analysis of iPod generates the tokens ""i"", ""pod"", ""ipod"" (with pod and ipod in the same position),
then the highlighter will output this as iipod, regardless of if any of those tokens are highlighted.

1,"Duplicate attribute in BeanDescriptor and CollectionDescriptor2 different attributes are used in BeanDescriptor and CollectionDescriptor to store the jcr type (jcrType and jcrNodeType). JcrNodeType can be removed. 
This imply modifications in  the DTD, the pm implementation and the different mapping xml files used for the unit tests. 

Furthermore, it should be nice to use the same name (jcrType)  in all descriptors.  There is a lot of confusion across the different descriptors. sometime jcrType is used, sometime jcrNodeType is used. I propose to use only jcrType with the following purpose : 

* In the ClassDescriptor, it  is used to store the primary node type of the class. 
* In the FieldDescriptor, it  is used to store the property type. 
* In the BeanDescriptor  it is used to defined the child node type. 
* In the CollectionDescriptor , it is used to defined the child node type. "

1,"Deadlock on version operations in a clustered environmentVersion operations in a cluster may end up in a deadlock: a write operation in the version store will acquire the version manager's write lock (N1.VW) and subsequently the cluster journal's write lock (N1.JW). Another cluster node's write operation in some workspace will acquire the journal's write lock (N2.JW) and first process the journal record log: if some of these changes concern the version store, the version manager's read lock (N2.VR) has to be acquired in order to deliver them. If the first cluster node reaches N1.VW, and the second reaches N2.JW, we have a deadlock. The same scenario takes place when the second cluster node synchronizes to the latest journal changes and reaches N2.JR, when the first cluster node is in N1.VW."

1,"Deadlock: IndexWriter.addIndexes(IndexReader[])A deadlock issue occurs under the following circumstances
- IndexWriter.autoCommit == true

I put together a JUnit test that recreates the deadlock, which I've attached.  It is the first test method, 'testAddIndexByIndexReader()'.

In a nutshell, here is what happens:

        // 1) AddIndexes(IndexReader[]) acquires the write lock,
        // then begins optimization of destination index (this is
        // prior to adding any external segments).

1,"ClusterNode not properly shutdown when repository has shutdownSometimes when the repository is shutdown the ClusterNode is not shutdown and it therefore tries to update records or access a closed Journal file.  The setup that generated the exception is I have 3 VMs each with a Repository that are all connected to the same database.  In the below stack trace one of the repositories is being shutdown however the ClusterNode thread is also trying to update the repository journal at the same time.

1,"DirectoryTaxonomyWriter can lose the INDEX_CREATE_TIME property, causing DirTaxoReader.refresh() to falsely succeed (or fail)DirTaxoWriter sets createTime to null after it put it in the commit data once. But that's wrong because if one calls commit(Map<>) twice, the second time doesn't record the creation time. Also, in the ctor, if an index exists and OpenMode is not CREATE, the creation time property is not read.

I wrote a couple of unit tests that assert this, and modified DirTaxoWriter to always record the creation time (in every commit) -- that's the only safe way.

Will upload a patch shortly."

1,"IndexDeletionPolicy.delete behaves incorrectly when deleting latest generation I have been looking to provide the ability to rollback committed transactions and encountered some issues.
I appreciate IndexDeletionPolicy's main motivation is to handle cleaning away OLD commit points but it does not explicitly state that it can or cannot be used to clean NEW commit points.

If this is not supported then the documentation should ideally state this. If the intention is to support this behaviour then read on .......

There seem to be 2 issues so far:
1) The first attempt to call IndexCommit.delete on the latest commit point fails to remove any contents. The subsequent call succeeds however
2) Deleting the latest commit point fails to update the segments.gen file to point to segments_N-1. New IndexReaders that are opened are then misdirected to open segments_N which has been deleted

1,"DateValue.equals() relies on Calendar.equals()JSR170 states regarding Date values:
""The text format of dates must follow the following ISO 8601:2000-compliant format"".

While DateValue.valueOf(String) and DateValue.getString() both rely on the functionality provided by the org.apache.jackrabbit.util.ISO8601, DateValue.equals() compares the equality of the internal Calendar object (DateValue line 89). This may return false even if the Iso-format of both values are equal.

In other words: Creating a new DateValue using the ValueFactory from the String representation of an existing DateValue will return an object, that is not equal to the original DateValue. The reason for this is, that the String does not contain all infomation, that is used during Calendar.equals.

The code is here

It looks like getMaxBufferedDocs used to return 10, and now it returns -1, not sure when that started happening.

My suggestion would be to just remove these three lines.  Since speed has already improved vastly, there isn't a need to speed things up.

To run this, Syns2Index requires two args.  The first is the location of the wn_s.pl file, and the second is the directory to create the index in."
1,"IndexWriter.addIndexes results in java.lang.OutOfMemoryErrorI'm re-opening a bug I logged previously. My previous bug report has 
disappeared. 

Issue: IndexWriter.addIndexes results in java.lang.OutOfMemoryError for large 
merges.

Until this writing, I've been merging successfully only through repetition, 
i.e. I keep repeating merges until a success. As my index size has grown, my 
success rate has steadily declined. I've reached the point where merges now 
fail 100% of the time. I can't merge.

My tests indicate the threshold is ~30GB on P4/800MB VM with 6 indexes. I have 
repeated my tests on many different machines (not machine dependent). I have 
repeated my test using local and attached storage devices (not storage 
dependent).

For what its worth, I believe the exception occurs entirely during the optimize 
process which is called implicitly after the merge. I say this because each 
time it appears the correct amount of bytes are written to the new index. Is it 
possible to decouple the merge and optimize processes?


The code snippet follows. I can send you the class file and 120GB data set. Let 
me know how you want it.

1,"VirtualNodeTypeStateProvider creates PropertyState with type != value(s).getTypeVirtualNodeTypeStateProvider creates the item states for the in content representation of the node type definitions and in case of jcr:defaultValues hard codes the type of the property state (thus the jcr property) to PropertyType.STRING.

the nt-definition of nt:propertyDefinition however states that jcr:defaultValues doesn't have a required type, thus the type should rather be determined based on the values themselves.

the current behaviour leads situations where

1,"DirectoryTaxonomyReader.refresh misbehaves with ref countsDirectoryTaxonomyReader uses the internal IndexReader in order to track its own reference counting. However, when you call refresh(), it reopens the internal IndexReader, and from that point, all previous reference counting gets lost (since the new IndexReader's refCount is 1).

The solution is to track reference counting in DTR itself. I wrote a simple unit test which exposes the bug (will be attached with the patch shortly)."
1,"QueryParser does not correctly handle escaped characters within quoted stringsThe Lucene query parser incorrectly handles escaped characters inside quoted strings; specifically, a quoted string that ends with an (escaped) backslash followed by any additional quoted string will not be properly tokenized. Consider the following example:

bq. {{(name:""///mike\\\\\\"") or (name:""alphonse"")}}

This is not a contrived example -- it derives from an actual bug we've encountered in our system. Running this query will throw an exception, but removing the second clause resolves the problem. After some digging I've found that the problem is with the way quoted strings are processed by the lexer: you'll notice that Mike's name is followed by three escaped backslashes right before the ending quote; looking at the JavaCC code for the query parser highlights the problem:

{code:title=QueryParser.jj|borderStyle=solid}
<DEFAULT> TOKEN : {
  <AND:       (""AND"" | ""&&"") >
| <OR:        (""OR"" | ""||"") >
| <NOT:       (""NOT"" | ""!"") >
| <PLUS:      ""+"" >
| <MINUS:     ""-"" >
| <LPAREN:    ""("" >
| <RPAREN:    "")"" >
| <COLON:     "":"" >
| <STAR:      ""*"" >
| <CARAT:     ""^"" > : Boost
| <QUOTED:     ""\"""" (~[""\""""] | ""\\\"""")* ""\"""">
...
{code}

Take a look at the way the QUOTED token is constructed -- there is no lexical processing of the escaped characters within the quoted string itself. In the above query the lexer matches everything from the first quote through all the backslashes, _treating the end quote as an escaped character_, thus also matching the starting quote of the second term. This causes a lexer error, because the last quote is then considered the start of a new match.

I've come to understand that the Lucene query handler is supposed to be able to handle unsanitized human input; indeed the lexer above would handle a query like {{""blah\""}} without complaining, but that's a ""best-guess"" approach that results in bugs with legal, automatically generated queries. I've attached a patch that fixes the erroneous behavior but does not maintain leniency with malformed queries; I believe this is the correct approach because the two design goals are fundamentally at odds. I'd appreciate any comments."

1,"NameSet does not implement equals(Object) and hashCode() methodsThe merge context uses the NameSet.equals(NameSet) method to compare two sets; however, the NameSet class does not override the default Object.equals(Object) method, and does not inherit from AbstractSet<E>.  Therefore, the merge check fails, even though the mixin sets are the same.  Object instance equivalence is being performed as opposed to set equivalence.  Behavior is observed when more than one thread is checking the ISM at a given time.  Demonstration code available upon request.

From NodeStateMerger, line 83:

1,"Large Lucene index can hit false OOM due to Sun JRE issueThis is not a Lucene issue, but I want to open this so future google
diggers can more easily find it.

There's this nasty bug in Sun's JRE:

  http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6478546

The gist seems to be, if you try to read a large (eg 200 MB) number of
bytes during a single RandomAccessFile.read call, you can incorrectly
hit OOM.  Lucene does this, with norms, since we read in one byte per
doc per field with norms, as a contiguous array of length maxDoc().

The workaround was a custom patch to do large file reads as several
smaller reads.

Server: Unauthorized.
Client: GET / and includes authentication.
Server: 302 to /something on the same host (this shows that in principle authentication works)
Client: GET /something,  does not include authentication

Client quits with 401-Unauthorized.

I would have expected one of the following instead:

1) Client immediately sends authorization information with the redirected GET /something
2) Client re-requests the /something with authorization after 401-Unauthorized.

We could get around the problem by setting the ConnectionReuseStrategy to a constant false.

Reason: upon processing the SPI Event (-> HierarchyEventListener#onEvent) the parent is retrieved by the Event ItemId, which in the former case contains a uniqueID part, which is not known yet to the listening Session-B.
Consequently the NodeEntry affected by the event is not updated.

Possible fix: If looking up the parent entry of the event doesn't succeed, a 2nd lookup using the Event path should be performed."
1,"Session.impersonate non-functionalCurrently SessionImpl.impersonate simply calls Repository.login with the given credentials and the workspace name of the session. If the credentials are incomplete in that the password is missing, the method throws a ""LoginException: Failed to authenticate userID"", which is actually a misleading text, as the reason is not failure to authenticate userID but at best that the session has not enough access rights to impersonate as userID.

For my application, it is crucial, that Session.impersonate is implemented in the sense that this method allows creation of a session with password-less credentials. I accept this method to fail, but it should fail with a correct message."

1,"Possible HttpClient codepage issue (ascii/ebcdic) on WebSphere z/OSI am working with Cactus 1.4.1 on WebSphere NT and also WebSphere z/OS
(mainframe). The problem seems to be with HTTPClient. I have tried with the
nuild on the 7th December.

I am trying to get basic cactus servlet tests working on WebSphere z/OS.
Everything works fine through WebSphere NT, however, when the same application
is deployed to WebSphere z/OS then we get the following error:

<?xml version=""1.0"" encoding=""UTF-8"" ?><?xml-stylesheet type=""text/xsl""

	... etc ...

I have verified that the Application Server on WebSPhere z/OS is working fine. I
set the logging on the cactus to DEBUG and noticed that the data that the
HTTPClient is retrieving from the connection is scrambled in some way. For example:

16:06:20,213 [WebSphere t=009d7920] DEBUG ent.HttpClientConnectionHelper  -
>getCookieString = [null] 
16:06:20,317 [WebSphere t=009d7920] DEBUG httpclient.wire                 - >> ""ÇÅã@aã?¢£Ã?? etc...

On WebSphere NT the data at this point looks OK.

What springs to mind is maybe ascii/ebcdic conversion problem. z/OS uses unicode
 for java, as it should. However, the HTTPClient creates it own socket
connection to the app server and therefore it is connecting to non java code. In
such a situation codepage conversion is necessary.

Could anybody adsvise on how to get this to work?

1,"empty host header with ip addressfile: HttpMethodBase.java method: addHostRequestHeader

HttpClient writes an empty Host header if the host is referred using IP address.
HTTP 1.1 RFC is not too clear what should be used in this case. However, other
HTTP 1.1 implementations (e.g. Java 1.4.0) uses IP address instead of dns name
in the header.

Furthermore, some HTTP server implementations (e.g. Jetty) will return ""400 bad
request"" if it encounters an empty Host header. That may be a bug in Jetty, but
it might be a good idea to use IP address in Host header to increase compability."
1,"addIndexesNoOptimize should not enforce maxMergeDocs/maxMergeSize limitIf you pass an index that has a segment > maxMergeDocs or maxMergeSize
to addIndexesNoOptimize, it throws an IllegalArgumentException.

But this check isn't reasonable because segment merging can easily
produce segments over these sizes since those limits apply to each
segment being merged, not to the final size of the segment produced.

So if you set maxMergeDocs to X, build up and index, then try to add
that index to another index that also has maxMergeDocs X, you can
easily hit the exception.

I think it's being too pedantic; I plan to just remove the checks for
sizes."
1,"Duplicate hits and missing hits in sorted searchIf using a searcher that subclasses from IndexSearcher I get different result sets (besides the ordering of course). The problem only occurrs if the searcher is wrapped by (Parallel)MultiSearcher and the index is not too small. The number of hits returned by un unsorted and a sorted search are identical but the hits are referencing different documents. A closer look at the result sets revealed that the sorted search returns duplicate hits.

I created test cases for Lucene 1.4.3 as well as for the head release. The problem showed up for both, the number of duplicates beeing bigger for the head realease. The test cases are written for package org.apache.lucene.search. There are messages describing the problem written to the console. In order to see all those hints the asserts are commented out. So dont't be confused if junit reports no errors. (Sorry, beeing a novice user of the bug tracker I don't see any means to attach the test cases on this screen. Let's see.)"

1,"Exception in deleteDocument, undeleteAll or setNorm in IndexReader can fail to release write lock on closeI hit this while working on LUCENE-140

We have 3 cases in the IndexReader methods above where we have this pattern:

  if (directoryOwner) acquireWriteLock();
  doSomething();
  hasChanges = true;

The problem is if you hit an exception in doSomething(), and hasChanges was not already true, then hasChanges will not have been set to true yet the write lock is held.  If you then try to close the reader without making any other changes, then the write lock is not released because in IndexReader.close() (well, in commit()) we only release write lock if hasChanges is true.

I think the simple fix is to swap the order of hasChanges = true and doSomething().  I already fixed one case of this under LUCENE-140 commit yesterday; I will fix the other two under this issue."
1,"AbstractLoginModule must not call abort() in commit()AbstractLoginModule.commit() currently may call abort() when it detects that the login did not succeed. abort() will reset any state in the login module, including state shared between multiple login modules like Principals in the Subject. When there actually are multiple module, this will delete shared state that was set by other login modules. Moreover, the method commit() is only called when the overall authentication succeeded. Thus, it seems strange to call abort() from within commit().

1,"Item.remove fails if a child-item is not visible to the editing sessionthe following test setup fails:

- a given session is allowed to remove a node
- the node has a policy child node which is not visible to the editing session (missing ac-read permission)
  OR the node has another invisible child item which could - based on the permissions above - be removed by that session.

calling Node.remove however fails with accessdeniedexception because the internal remove
mechanism accesses all child items to mark them removed. however, the access is executed
using the regular itemmgr calls that are used to retrieve the items using the JCR API which
results in accessdenied exception as those child items are not visible to the session.
since the items can be removed i would argue that this is a bug in the internal remove process.

I see the code is no longer problematic in the trunk (and others ported from flex_1458), looks it was fixed while implementing post 3.x features.

How to reproduce: enable clustering in the test environment and let the test o.a.j.core.XATest.testSetVersionLabel() run. This will result in a deadlock when committing the operation.

This was initially reported by Rafał Kwiecień as a problem when using springmodules and clustering but turned out to be general problem with transactions and clustering. Thanks for reporting it!"
1,"RangeQuery & RangeFilter used with collation seek to lowerTerm using compareTo()The constructor for RangeTermEnum initializes a TermEnum starting with lowerTermText, but when a collator is defined, all terms in the given field need to be checked, since collation can introduce non-Unicode orderings.  Instead, the RangeTermEnum constructor should test for a non-null collator, and if there is one, point the TermEnum at the first term in the given field.

1,"Version history recovery fails in case a version does not have a jcr:frozenNodeWith JCR-2551 in place, a version recovery mode has been introduced. Problem now is that in case a version is encountered that misses a mandatory jcr:frozenNode, an InternalError is thrown by o.a.j.c.version.InternalVersionHistoryImpl#createVersionInstance. Since o.a.j.c.RepositoryChecker#checkVersionHistory only catches Exception, it fails to catch it properly which leads to a complete repository shutdown.

Throwing for example a RuntimeException instead fixes the problem."
1,"Invalid journal records during XATransactionsDuring the prepare phase of a XATransaction, XAItemStateManager.prepare calls ShareItemStageManager.beginUpdate that, in case of a ClusterNode, calls ClusterNode.updatePrepared that does a ChangeLogRecord.write().

This last method is located in ClusterRecord and systematically write the begin and the end of the journal record.

As a consequence, useless corrupted records are written in the journal everytime a transaction ends without jackrabbit update! This causes polution of the journal, as other cluster nodes try to sync with the corrupted updates and fail doing so as ClusterRecordDeserializer can't deserialize it (the record identifier is empty).

ChangeLogRecord (and even other ClusterRecord implementations too) should only write if there's effective updates.

I propose the following solution:
*) add the following method in Changelog so clients can know if there's effective updates:
    public boolean hasUpdates() {
    	return !(addedStates.isEmpty() && modifiedStates.isEmpty() && deletedStates.isEmpty() && modifiedRefs.isEmpty());
    }

*) change ClusterRecord with:
    public final void write() throws JournalException {
    	
    	if (hasUpdates()) {
	        record.writeString(workspace);
	        doWrite();
	        record.writeChar(END_MARKER);
    	}
    }
    
    protected abstract boolean hasUpdates();

*) implement hasUpdates for every ClusterRecord implementation:
 ----> ChangeLogRecord:
    protected boolean hasUpdates() {
    	return changes.hasUpdates() || !events.isEmpty();
    }
 ----> LockRecord and NamespaceRecord:
    protected boolean hasUpdates() {
    	return true;
    }

 ----> NodeTypeRecord:
    protected boolean hasUpdates() {
    	return !collection.isEmpty();
    }

1,"CorruptIndexException on indexing after a failure occurs after segments file creation but before any bytes are writtenFSDirectory.createOutput(..) uses a RandomAccessFile to do its work.  On my system the default FSDirectory.open(..) creates an NIOFSDirectory.  If createOutput is called on a segments_* file and a crash occurs between RandomAccessFile creation (file system shows a segments_* file exists but has zero bytes) but before any bytes are written to the file, subsequent IndexWriters cannot proceed.  The difficulty is that it does not know how to clear the empty segments_* file.  None of the file deletions will happen on such a segment file because the opening bytes cannot not be read to determine format and version.

From the javadocs for CharSequence:

This interface does not refine the general contracts of the equals and hashCode methods. The result of comparing two objects that implement CharSequence is therefore, in general, undefined. Each object may be implemented by a different class, and there is no guarantee that each class will be capable of testing its instances for equality with those of the other. {color:red} It is therefore inappropriate to use arbitrary CharSequence instances as elements in a set or as keys in a map. {color}

1,"Jackrabbit thread contention issue due to fat lockHello,

We are running jackrabbit 1.4.5 using a persistent file data store within a weblogic container and encountering a variety of thread locking issues. To get around the problem, we are forced synchronize thread access to the JCR repository or reduce thread worker count to 1 which has a heavy performance impact on our application. I'm not exactly sure what the problem is and was wondering someone is looking into this issue and if there is a workaround/fix planned?

1,"PerFieldCodecWrapper causes crashes if not all per field codes have been usedIf a PerFieldCodecWrapper is used an SegmentMerger tries to merge two segments where one segment only has a subset of the field PerFieldCodecWrapper defines SegmentMerger tries to open non-existing files since Codec#files(Directory, SegmentInfo, Set<String>) blindly copies the expected files into the given set. This also hits exceptions in CheckIndex and addIndexes(). 
The reason for this is that PerFieldCodecWrapper simply iterates over the codecs it knows and adds all files without checking if they are present in the given Directory. We need to have some mechnanism that check if the ""required"" files for a codec are present and only add the files to the set if that field is really there.

As an short term solution we should disable indexing of VirtualNodeStates.

1,"URLEncodedUtils fails to parse form-url-encoded entities that specify a charsetIf a form-url-encoded HTTP entity specifies a charset in its Content-Type header, then URLEncodedUtils.parse(HttpEntity) fails to parse it.

An entity with content type ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8"" should be detected as form-url-encoded and parsed as such, honoring the specified character set. Currently the code requires an exact, case-insensitive match with ""application/x-www-form-urlencoded"" for an entity to be detected as form-url-encoded.

It appears that the author of URLEncodedUtils.parse(HttpEntity) tried to take character sets into account, but expected to find them in the Content-Encoding header instead of as a parameter in the Content-Length header. The HTTP 1.1 spec makes it clear that the Content-Encoding header is for specifying transformations like gzip compression or the identity transformation -- not for specifying the entity's character set.

1,"addIndexes(IndexReader) incorrectly applies existing deletesIf you perform these operations:
# deleteDocuments(Term) for all the new documents
# addIndexes(IndexReader)
# commit

Then addIndexes applies the previous deletes on the incoming indexes as well, which is incorrect. If you call addIndexes(Directory) instead, the deletes are applied beforehand, as they should.

1,"BasicCookieStore.getCookies() returns non-threadsafe collectionBasicCookieStore.getCookies() is a simple method.  It's synchronized, and it returns an unmodifiable wrapper around the underlying cookie list.  If the caller were to then iterate over it as another thread were to manipulate the cookie list via BasicCookieStore, this would create a thread un-safe situation because both threads aren't doing their reading/writing with the same lock (the reader doesn't even have a lock).

I suggest fixing this by using CopyOnWriteArrayList, or by making a defensive copy in getCookies()

1,"SO_TIMEOUT not set early enough for SOCKS proxies in PlainSocketFactoryI've created my own delegating SchemeSocketFactory implementation which supports setting SOCKS proxies on socket creation. In the connectSocket implementation, I previously just delegated to PlainSocketFactory.

The problem there was, that the SO_TIMEOUT was not set on the socket before the connection was established through the SOCKS proxy. This lead to a stop on the native read0 method because the socket is endlessly waiting for a read to occur from the proxy, so it can continue with the the connect to the actual socket destination through the proxy. I made sure I set the SO_TIMEOUT parameter in HttpParams, but it did not get honored by PlainSocketFactory.

To fix this and make HttpClient honor SO_TIMEOUT for SOCKS proxies, the following line has to be added:
  sock.setSoTimeout(HttpConnectionParams.getSoTimeout(params));
in PlainSocketFactory.connectSocket(...).

Heres the complete fixed method:

PlainSocketFactory:            
    public Socket connectSocket(
            final Socket socket,
            final InetSocketAddress remoteAddress,
            final InetSocketAddress localAddress,
            final HttpParams params) throws IOException, ConnectTimeoutException {
        if (remoteAddress == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""Remote address may not be null"");
        }
        if (params == null) {
            throw new IllegalArgumentException(""HTTP parameters may not be null"");
        }
        Socket sock = socket;
        if (sock == null) {
            sock = createSocket();
        }
        if (localAddress != null) {
            sock.setReuseAddress(HttpConnectionParams.getSoReuseaddr(params));
            sock.bind(localAddress);
        }
        
        //FIX for SOCKS proxies which get stalled if they don't answer
        sock.setSoTimeout(HttpConnectionParams.getSoTimeout(params));
        
        int timeout = HttpConnectionParams.getConnectionTimeout(params);
        try {
            sock.connect(remoteAddress, timeout);
        } catch (SocketTimeoutException ex) {
            throw new ConnectTimeoutException(""Connect to "" + remoteAddress.getHostName() + ""/""
                    + remoteAddress.getAddress() + "" timed out"");
        }
        return sock;
    }

Currently I've implemented this in my delegating SchemeSocketFactory, because PlainSocketFactory misses this setting.

Dunno if there are other implementations of SocketFactory in HttpClient, which might need this fix. Anyway I hope this helps other people who get  headaches about halting threads because they use SOCKS proxies. :)"

the property in question is the last property of a node and it's an empty string. the error only occurs on certain usage patterns, but consistently. maybe depending on the fetch-depth or internal cache.

extending the check to:

1,"WebDAV LocatorFactoryImpl$Locator.getHref() constructs root resource URLs incorrectlycadaver was reporting an error when i tried to open / in my repository's default workspace at <https://localhost:8443/webdav/).

in tracking down the problem, i saw something strange - the multistatus response's href had an extra ""/"" tacked onto the end:

  <D:multistatus xmlns:D=""DAV:"">
    <D:response>
      <D:href>https://localhost:8443/webdav//</D:href>

WebdavServlet (rather, my subclass of it) is mapped as the default servlet of a webapp mounted at /webdav. i've configured the WebdavServlet with a resource path prefix of """" (incidentally, i'm not sure what that's meant to be used for - i see that when the value is not empty, it's appended to the response's href, but i don't know in what circumstance that would be useful).

when i requested a child node such as <https://localhost:8443/webdav/bcm>, the response's href was formed as expected:

  <D:multistatus xmlns:D=""DAV:"">
    <D:response>
      <D:href>https://localhost:8443/webdav/bcm/</D:href>

i found that LocatorFactoryImpl$Locator.getHref() was adding the extra ""/"" since the requested resource was a collection. i patched the method to not add the character when itemPath == ""/"", and cadaver stopped complaining. all is well.

i also patched WebdavServlet to default to an empty resource path prefix if one is not specified as a servlet init parameter.

If the index directory gets deleted out from under Lucene after the FSDirectory has been created, then attempts to open an IndexWriter or IndexReader will result in an NPE.  Lucene should be throwing an IOException in this case.

Repro:
    1) Create an FSDirectory pointing somewhere in the filesystem (e.g. /foo/index/1)
    2) rm -rf the parent dir (rm -rf /foo/index)
    3) Try to open an IndexReader

Result: NullPointerException on line ""for(int i=0;i<files.length;i++) { "" -- 'files' is NULL.
 
Expect: IOException


....  

This is happening because of a missing NULL check in SegmentInfos$FindSegmentsFile.run():

        if (0 == method) {
          if (directory != null) {
            files = directory.list();

The FSDirectory constructor will make sure the index dir exists, but if it is for some reason deleted out from underneath Lucene after the FSDirectory is instantiated, then java.io.File.list() will return NULL.

Status 0 is STATUS_UNDEFINED. I think the following happens: when the reading session retrieves the ItemState from the SharedItemStateManager it is still valid but a short time later the writing session removes the item and changes the status to STATUS_UNDEFINED. Then the reading session tries to create an overlayed ItemState for the LocalItemStateManager using the changed status.

Adding the STATUS_UNDEFINED to the list of 'valid' status in the ItemState constructor seems to solve the issue, but I'm not sure if that's the right way to do it.

1,"MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager daemon Thread never GC'dOne of my colleagues was invoking HttpClient by way of a loop something like this:

}

He's in the process of revising his code so that he doesn't do this loop, which
other developers might point out as a non-optimal use, but along the way, he
discovered that the daemon thread that the MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManager
makes does not get garbage collected.  Of course, the connection manager itself
is also never gc'd.  While I think we can avoid this problem in our code, in the
more general case, clients may not actually be able to control the number of
MultiThreadedConnectionManagers they create, which could eventually cause
problems.  This makes me think the problem is deserving of a patch.

We found this problem with 2.0rc2, although presumably it also exists with the
CVS HEAD.

1,"Cannot clone BasicClientCookie2 without specified portsThe clone method returns a null pointer exception when called on a BasicClientCookie2 that does not use any ports properties.
In other words, it is impossible to clone a BasicClientCookie2 instance without ports specification.

In the clone() method, they are two main instructions :
 - calling clone() method on super
 - calling clone() method on the ports integer array (which is null)

It may be a good idea to check whether the array is null or not

1,"ConnPoolByRoute driving RouteSpecificPool to IllegalStateHi all,

I encountered an issue on ConnPoolByRoute / RouteSpecificPool on HTTPClient 4.0.1, akin to HTTPCLIENT-747 (it also leads to a java.lang.IllegalStateException: No entry created for this pool. HttpRoute[{}XXX] ), but it is not a concurrency issue (no race condition, just a logic error if I understood it correctly).

From my understanding, the error lies in ConnPoolByRoute#getEntryBlocking
Quoting from the code (line 309-314) :
RouteSpecificPool rospl = getRoutePool(route, true);
... 
} else if (hasCapacity && !freeConnections.isEmpty()) {

deleteLeastUsedEntry();
entry = createEntry(rospl, operator);

} else { ...

The short version of the issue is : under certain circumstances, #deleteLeastUsedEntry can remove rospl from the map of known RootSpecificPool. But as this code still holds on to the rospl instance, it will modify its state in a way the pool will never recover from later, not having any other way to access this instance when the connection gets released.

A Step by Step guide to what's going wrong.
0) You have to be in a condition that leads to the execution of said code extract (i.e. no free entry on the current route - but the route already is registered to the global pool -, current Route has capacity, max connections reached for the global pool, but there are free connections to destroy).
2) We arrive in deleteLeastUsedEntry(). We get the last entry from a queue. It can be that this entry is bound to the same (hashCode() wise) Route that the one we are getting a connection to (i.e. rospl instance held in the #getEntryBlocking context)
3) this entry can be the last of its pool, thus at this point, rospl.isUnused() == true
4) As a consequence, deleteEntry() will remove rospl from the routeToPool map
5) Back in the getEntryBlocking method, we do entry = createEntry(rospl, operator), which will do createdEntry() on the ""locally-scoped"" rospl instance that has just been removed from routeToPool 
6) When the connexion from this new entry is released at some point in the future, the rospl instance that got the createdEntry() does not exist anymore, and it is a new one that gets the freeEntry() call
7) App breaks : this newly created RouteSpecificPool throws IllegalStateException.

Step 0, though, is a rare condition that I only reached during stress tests, and on a SSL client-auth server. This is so because this is the only condition that I know of in HTTPClient, where there is a keep-alive connection in the RouteSpecificPool that can not be reused (when the State is set to the X500 principals of the client cert in the pool, but not in the request).

Possible fix (from what I understand) :
The rospl instance variable in the context of getEntryBlocking() should be protected against the consequences of #deleteLeastUsedEntry().
Not being confortable with all issues at hand, nor with the code base, the simplest thing I can think of would be to preemptively reset the rospl variable after deleteLeastUsedEntry(), thus writing the previous code extract as :

} else if (hasCapacity && !freeConnections.isEmpty()) {

deleteLeastUsedEntry();
// delete may have made deprecated the RouteSpecificPool instance
rospl = getRoutePool(route, true);
entry = createEntry(rospl, operator);

} else { ...


I have a test case that I will attach to this issue ASAP.
It is a simple example that triggers the above conditions with 3 HttpGet calls, in a serial fashion. As stated previsouly, these calls need nothing particular, except that one of these calls must go to a HTTPS server with client-side certificate authentication (I guess NTLM would be OK, anything that will place a non null state along with the route in BasicEntryPool).

I hope code is self-explainatory. I get 100% failure in my setup. Just configure your 2 URLS, configure classpath, set your keystores system properties, and launch.

Workaround :
Best workaround I found is : do not get to step 0.
The most robust way I found to do that (i.e. a way that does not involve things like setting max pool size to a gigantic number that can never be reached, ...) is to actively set the ClientContext.USER_TOKEN attribute in an exec context while submitting the request to the client.
Step 0 triggers when there is an idle connection that waits, and when this idle connection can not be reused, which can only happen if the request's ""USER_TOKEN"" does not match the BasicPoolEntry#getState(). As, in the SSL case, the state is the SSL Cert's X500PrincipalName, and I know it in advance, it's easy to set up front.

By the way, this taught me that I never could benefit from connection reuse strategies in this SSL case, as connections would always get into the pool with a USER_TOKEN that my requests never had. Don't know if it's mentionned somewhere in the documentation, but this is a noteworthy fact to me.

Please feel free to comment / correct any mistakes."

1,"Deadlock between SingleClientConnManager.releaseConnection() and SingleClientConnManager.shutdown()It's possible to create a deadlock within SingleClientConnectionManager.

When JMeter interrupts a test, it calls HttpUriRequest.abort(), and as part of thread end processing it calls SingleClientConnManager.shutdown().

See deadlock details below.

I don't yet know why the shutdown is called before the abort finishes; that is probably a bug.

However, there may be a issue with the locking strategy within SCCM, hence this report.

you'll still see file handles open against files that have been

This count will not grow unbounded, since it's limited by the number
of segments in the index, but it's still a serious problem since the

1,"MoreLikeThis reuses a reader after it has already closed itMoreLikeThis has a fatal bug whereby it tries to reuse a reader for multiple fields:

{code}
    Map<String,Int> words = new HashMap<String,Int>();

        String fieldName = fieldNames[i];
        addTermFrequencies(r, words, fieldName);
    }
{code}

However, addTermFrequencies() is creating a TokenStream for this reader:

{code}
    TokenStream ts = analyzer.reusableTokenStream(fieldName, r);
    int tokenCount=0;
    // for every token
    CharTermAttribute termAtt = ts.addAttribute(CharTermAttribute.class);

My first thought was that it seems like a ""ReaderFactory"" of sorts should be passed in so that a new Reader can be created for the second field (maybe the factory could be passed the field name, so that if someone wanted to pass a different reader to each, they could.)

Interestingly, the methods taking File and URL exhibit the same issue.  I'm not sure what to do about those (and we're not using them.)  The method taking File could open the file twice, but the method taking a URL probably shouldn't fetch the same URL twice.

1,"HttpClient does not properly handle 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' encodingAs always I'd like to pass on my thanks, I'm finding HttpClient really useful.

The problem occurs because I use Struts map based ActionForm and these generate 
request parameters of the form:

<input type=""text"" name=""searchSelection(c)"">

When this is submitted using the PostMethod class the generateRequestBody() is 
called and in turn this calls the URI.encode() method with a BitSet of the 
acceptable characters. In this case the '(' and ')' characters are marked as 
acceptable.

The problem is that this does not work correctly when I submit it to my remote 
server. If however I issue the request directly (from a webpage rather than 
using HttpClient) it works and when I examine the request input stream I can see 
that the parameter has been re-written so that 'select(c)' is displayed as 
'select%28c%29'.

This may be my error because of encoding problems or the fact I am not setting 
the content type etc. correctly. Or it could be a bug. I'm afraid my HTTP 
knowledge is not good enough.

1,FineGrainedISMLocking problemsThe FineGrainedISMLocking strategy suffers from the same deadlock issue as was reported in JCR-2753 against DefaultISMLocking. Additionally the FineGrainedISMLocking class will also fail to function properly with XA transactions since it uses the current thread instead of the current transaction id to track re-entrancy.

1,"[PATCH] When locks are disabled, IndexWriter.close() throws NullPointerExceptionIf locks are disabled (via setting the System property 'disableLuceneLocks' to
true), IndexWriter throws a NullPointerException on closing. The reason is that
the attempt to call writeLock.release() fails because writeLock is null.
To correct this, just check for this case before releasing. A (trivial) patch is
attached."
1,"In XA transaction session.addLockToken() does not have effectFollowing sequence does not work as expected:

3. third tx (and third session)

The same sequence works as expected without transactions.

1,"[PATCH] MultiSearcher problems with Similarity.docFreq()When MultiSearcher invokes its subsearchers, it is the subsearchers' docFreq()
that is accessed by Similarity.docFreq().  This causes idf's to be computed
local to each index rather than globally, which causes ranking across multiple
indices to not be equivalent to ranking across the entire global collection.

The attached files (if I can figure out how to attach them) provide a potential
partial solution for this.  They properly fix a simple test case, RankingTest,
that was provided by Daniel Naber.

The changes are:
  1.  Searcher:  Add topmostSearcher() field with getter and setter to record
the outermost Searcher.  Default to this.
  2.  MultiSearcher:  Pass down the topmostSearcher when creating the subsearchers.
  3.  IndexSearcher:  Call Query.weight() everywhere with the topmostSearcher
instead of this.
  4.  Query:  Provide a default implementation of Query.combine() so that
MultiSearcher works with all queries.

Problems or possible problems I see:
  1.  This does not address the same issue with RemoteSearchable. 
RemoteSearchable is not a Searcher, nor can it be due to lack of multiple
inheritance in Java, but Query.weight() requires a Searcher.  Perhaps
Query.weight() should be changed to take a Searchable, but this requires
changing many places and I suspect would break apps.
  2.  There may be other places that topmostSearcher should be used instead of this.
  3.  The default implementation for Query.combine() is a guess on my part - it
works for TermQuery.  It's fragile in that the default implementation will hide
bugs caused by queries that inadvertently omit a more precise Query.combine()
method.
  4.  The prior comment on Query.combine() indicates that whoever wrote it was
fully aware of this problem and so probably had another usage in mind, so the
whole issue may just be Daniel's usage in the test case.  It's not apparent to
me, so I probably don't understand something."

1,"IndexReader.getCurrentVersion() and isCurrent should use commit lock.There is a race condition if one machine is checking the current version of an index while another wants to update the segments file in IndexWriter.close().

java.io.IOException: Cannot delete segments

	at org.apache.lucene.index.IndexWriter.close(IndexWriter.java:242)

On the windows platform reading the contents of a file disallows deleting the file.

I use Lucene to maintain an index of +-700.000 documents, one server adds documents, while other servers handle the searches.
The search servers poll the index version regularly to check if they have to reopen their IndexSearcher.
Once in a while (about once every two days on average), IndexWriter.close() fails because it cannot delete the previous segments file, even though it hold the commit lock.
The reason is probably that search servers are reading the segments file to check the version without using the commit lock.

1,"Multiple namespace definitions in CND prevent definition of node type without child nodesThe BNF in http://jackrabbit.apache.org/api-1/org/apache/jackrabbit/core/nodetype/compact/CompactNodeTypeDefReader.html
defines:

[...]
cnd ::= {ns_mapping | node_type_def}
[...]

so multiple namespace definitions should not affect the node type definitions.

However, the following CND definition will fail:

<namespace= 'http://www.mynamespace.co.uk/namespace'>
<nt = 'http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0'>
[namespace:document] > nt:file
   - namespace:name (string) mandatory

<namespace= 'http://www.mynamespace.co.uk/namespace'>
<nt = 'http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0'>
[namespace:document2] > nt:file
   - namespace:name (string) mandatory


Remove the second set of namespace definitions, and all's well:

<namespace= 'http://www.mynamespace.co.uk/namespace'>
<nt = 'http://www.jcp.org/jcr/nt/1.0'>
[namespace:document] > nt:file
   - namespace:name (string) mandatory

1,"OpenBitSet#hashCode() may return false for identical sets.OpenBitSet uses an internal buffer of long variables to store set bits and an additional 'wlen' index that points 
to the highest used component inside {@link #bits} buffer.

Unlike in JDK, the wlen field is not continuously maintained (on clearing bits, for example). This leads to a situation when wlen may point
far beyond the last set bit. 

The hashCode implementation iterates over all long components of the bits buffer, rotating the hash even for empty components. This is against the contract of hashCode-equals. The following test case illustrates this:

{code}
// initialize two bitsets with different capacity (bits length).
BitSet bs1 = new BitSet(200);
BitSet bs2 = new BitSet(64);
// set the same bit.
bs1.set(3);
bs2.set(3);
        
// equals returns true (passes).
assertEquals(bs1, bs2);
// hashCode returns false (against contract).
assertEquals(bs1.hashCode(), bs2.hashCode());

1,"Query with document order fails when result set size > caching hierarchy manager sizeWhen a query returns a lot of nodes in the query result and document order is enabled (which is the default) then the query will fail with error messages in the log:

The critical size seems to be equivalent to the cache size of the caching hierarchy manager. Attached are two test cases. The first one simply creates test nodes and the second one executes a query for those nodes.

been here for some time (created by accident in LUCENE-2881).  But the
good news is it should strike fairly rarely.

SegmentMerger sometimes incorrectly thinks it can bulk-copy TVs/stored
fields when it cannot (because field numbers don't map to the same
names across segments).

I think it happens only with addIndexes, or indexes that have
pre-trunk segments, and then SM falsely thinks it can bulk-merge only
when the last field number has the same field name across segments.

1,"HttpClient should always override the host of HostConfiguration if an absolute request URI is givenThis bug most likely occurs on all patforms and OS's, but I have only tested it
on WinXP.

The HttpClient.executeMethod(HostConfiguration,HttpMethod,HttpState) will
receive and throw an IllegalArgumentException stating that ""host parameter is
null"" when a  HostConfiguration object is passed in that ONLY has a proxy set
(via HostConfiguration.setProxy(String, int)). Details to reproduce follow--the
bug can be easily reproduced by using the Apache Axis 1.2 CommonsHTTPSender
class (with JVM system props http.proxyHost, http.proxyPort set):

There is a bug in the Apache Commons HTTP Client 3.0rc2 that does not set the
hostname property
in the <code>HostConfiguration</code> object if the following two steps
are performed:<br>
1. You call
<code>HttpClient.executeMethod(HostConfiguration,HttpMethod,HttpState)</code>
with a <code>HostConfiguration</code> object and an <code>HttpMethod</code> object
(created using the HttpMethod(String uri) constructor).This method 
is called in this exact way in the Apache Axis 1.2 client
(CommonsHTTPSender.java lines 132 and 186).<br>
2. That <code>HostConfiguration</code> object only has a proxy set (using
setProxy(String, int)). This method 
is called in this exact way in the Apache Axis 1.2 client
(CommonsHTTPSender.java line 389).<br>

Apache Axis 1.2rc3 CommonsHTTPSender.java did not expose this bug in Commons
HTTP Client 3.0rc2 because
it set the <code>HostConfiguration</code> in a different manner, as follows:<br>
1. Call <code>HttpClient.setHostConfiguration(HostConfiguration)</code> first.
Again,
The <code>HostConfiguration</code> object must only have a proxy set and no host
name.<br>
2. Then call <code>HttpClient.executeMethod(HttpMethod)</code>.<br>

Using the above steps (as in Axis 1.2rc3 CommonsHTTPSender.java, invoke()
method), line 379 in HttpClient.java evaluates to true
because the argument <code>hostConfiguration</code> is null (see line 324 in
HttpClient.java) and the local 
variable <code>defaultHostConfiguration</code> ==
<code>HttpClient.setHostConfiguration(HostConfiguration)</code>
which was set in item #1 above. The hostname then gets set in the
<code>HostConfiguration</code>
object in line 384 of HttpClient.java."

1,"""Socket Closed"" IOException thrown by HttpConnectionHttpClient.java was modified in version 2.0 Final in method executeMethod().
The call to connection.setSoTimeout() used to be in RC3 after the call to
connection.isOpen(), but in the final version the call happens before the call 
to isOpen(). The result of the change is that the setSoTimeout() call could 
throw IOException because of closed socket.

I would fix the problem by adding to HttpConnection.setSoTimeout() (and to 
other similar methods in HttpConnection) an explicit check (a call to isOpen
()) whether the socket is closed as the existence of socket object does not 
guarantee it. I.e the following code:

    public void setSoTimeout(int timeout)
        throws SocketException, IllegalStateException {
        LOG.debug(""HttpConnection.setSoTimeout("" + timeout + "")"");
        soTimeout = timeout;
        if (socket != null) {
            socket.setSoTimeout(timeout);
        }
    }

would be changed to

    public void setSoTimeout(int timeout)
        throws SocketException, IllegalStateException {
        LOG.debug(""HttpConnection.setSoTimeout("" + timeout + "")"");
        soTimeout = timeout;
        if (isOpen()) {

1,"[PATCH] NullPointerException when using nested SpanOrQuery in SpanNotQueryOverview description: 
I'm using the span query classes in Lucene to generate higher scores for 
search results where the search terms are closer together. In certain 
situations I want to exclude terms from the span. When I attempt to exclude 
more than one term I get an error. 
 
The example query I'm using is:  
 
'brighton AND tourism' -pier -contents 
 
I construct the query objects and the toString() version is: 
 
spanNot(spanNear([contents:brighton contents:tourism], 10, false), 
spanOr([contents:pier, contents:road])) 
  
 
Steps to reproduce: 
1. Construct a SpanNearQuery (must have at least one term, but at least two 
makes more sense) 
2. Construct a SpanOrQuery containing two or more terms 
3. Construct a SpanNotQuery to include the first query object and exclude the 
second (SpanOrQuery) 
4. Execute the search 
 
 
Actual Results: 
A null pointer exception is thrown while generating the scores within the 
search.

Workspace.restore(Version[], boolean) won't work, since versions are not retrieved correctly. The version history that can be access from the request  resource, cannot be used to retrieve the versions needed for a workspace.restore call.

possible short term fix:
From the version-hrefs present in the request body of the UPDATE request, version resources must be built and
the corresponding version item retrieved.

alternative:
find a proper mapping for Workspace.restore(Version[], boolean). having UPDATE on a resource representing a javax.jcr.Node being mapped to a workspace.restore is odd.

1,"BoostingTermQuery.explain() bugsThere are a couple of minor bugs in BoostingTermQuery.explain().

1. The computation of average payload score produces NaN if no payloads were found. It should probably be:
float avgPayloadScore = super.score() * (payloadsSeen > 0 ? (payloadScore / payloadsSeen) : 1);

2. If the average payload score is zero, the value of the explanation is 0:
result.setValue(nonPayloadExpl.getValue() * avgPayloadScore);
If the query is part of a BooleanClause, this results in:
""no match on required clause...""
""failure to meet condition(s) of required/prohibited clause(s)""

The average payload score can be zero if the field boost = 0.

I've attached a patch to 'TestBoostingTermQuery.java', however, the test 'testNoPayload' fails in 'SpanScorer.score()' because the doc = -1. It looks like 'setFreqCurrentDoc() should have been called before 'score()'. Maybe someone more knowledgable of spans could investigate this.
"
1,"OCM:The UUID of the collection elements changes on update.On ocm.update transaction, the  Current implementation of DefaultCollectionConverterImpl recreates the colleciton-element nodes if there is no id field specificaiton.  This is completely valid for majority of the cases.  But I came across a case where the colleciton element has a uuid field.  In this case also what is happening with the current implementation is that it drops all the elements from the old collection-elements and recreates the new ones.  The major flip side is that now I am left with brand new UUIDs.  I think we should address the uniqueness characteristics specified through UUID also while mapping colleciton elements.

I have a patch and a TestCase to verify the same.  I have implemented it only for the digester.  If people feel the approach is right I will work out an annotation based testcase as well.  I do not think it is going to fail even with annotations.

1,"ChunkedInputStream broken (2 bugs + fixes, 1 suggestion)Bug 1.

In the     

read(byte[] b, int off, int len)  method

of ChunkedInputStream, the number of bytes to read from the underlying 
InputStream is calculated wrongly. In the code this is done by

len = Math.min(len, chunkSize);

This could (and will) cause the server (also Apache) to indeed serve that 
number of bytes (let's say chunkSize), but it may be that we already had a 
number of bytes on the first read. The result is that the input is now NOT 
positioned on the end of a chunk and the rest of the reader fails because it 
cannot find CRLF or a valid chunksize.

Proposed fix (works, tested)
len = Math.min(len, chunkSize-pos);

Bug 2.

In the calculation of the chunkSize (method getChunkSizeFromInputStream) the 
conversion to int is done by calling             

result = Integer.parseInt(dataString, 16);

This is not robust and causes the occasional crash. The fix is simple and in 
fact implements what is done when the chunkSize is commented (see lines in code 
above)

result = Integer.parseInt(dataString.trim(), 16);

Tested and works.



Suggestion:
Same routine, input state machine. Perhaps just being pedantic..change while 
loop to:

        while (state != 2) {
            int b = in.read();
            if (b == -1) throw new IOException(""chunked stream ended

1,"Checking of stale connections is brokenHttpConnections that went stale (dropped by server) throw SocketExceptions
instead of silently re-opening themselves, as has been the case with earlier
versions of HttpClient.

I think the problem for this can be found in HttpConnection:

  public boolean closeIfStale() throws IOException {
    if (used && isOpen && isStale()) {
      LOG.debug(""Connection is stale, closing..."");
      close();
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }

staleness is only checked if used = true, but there is no code in HttpConnection
that sets the used flag. In other words: used is always false and isStale() is
never called."
1,"HttpClient 4.1 ignores request retry handler and stops retrying when a read timeout is followed by a connection refusalI encountered an issue while writing unit tests for the RestBackup(tm) API Client Library, https://github.com/mleonhard/restbackup-java .  HttpClient 4.1 is failing to retry when it encounters a read timeout followed by a connection refusal.  This problem occurs on Windows but not on Linux.  Below is a short program that reproduces the problem.  It performs the expected 5 request attempts on Linux but only 2 on Windows.

My Windows environment is a laptop with Windows 7 Ultimate 64-bit and Oracle Java SE Development Kit Update 21 32-bit.  My Linux environment is Amazon EC2 with Ubuntu 10.04 LTS 32-bit and Oracle Java SE Development Kit Update 21 32-bit.

This is my first bug report to an Apache project.  I'd like to add that I'm a big fan of the Commons libraries and Http Components.

Subsequent calls on this connection, lead that the internal session variable is not anymore informed about the current transaction context. (XAItemStateManager, variables tx and txLog are null), because only the xaResource is informed about the new transaction context. Result is that the complete transaction handling does not work anymore.
I attached a sample project which shows this behaviour.
"
1,"Missing synchronization in InternalVersionHistoryImplThe InternalVersionHistoryImpl objects can be accessed (and modified) concurrently by multiple sessions, which can in some rare cases result in corruption in the internal cache map data structures. Access to these cache maps should be properly synchronized."
1,"Don't commit an empty segments_N when IW is opened with create=trueIf IW is opened with create=true, it forcefully commits an empty
segments_N.  But really it should not: if autoCommit is false, nothing
should be committed until commit or close is explicitly called.

"
1,"FSDirectory.openFile(String) causes ClassCastExceptionWhen you call FSDirectory.openFile(String) you get a ClassCastException since FSIndexInput is not an org.apache.lucene.store.InputStream

The workaround is to reimplement using openInput(String). I personally don't need this to be fixed but wanted to document it here in case anyone else runs into this for any reason.

The reason I'm calling this is that I have a requirement on my project to create read only indexes and name the index segments consistently from one build to the next. So, after creating and optimizing the index, I rename the files and rewrite the segments file. It would be nice if I had an API that would allow me to say ""I only want one segment and I want its name to be 'foo'"". For instance IndexWriter.optimize(String segmentName)"
1,"IndexReader.clone can leave files openI hit this in working on LUCENE-1516.

When not using compound file format, if you clone an IndexReader, then close the original, then close the clone, the stored fields files (_X.fdt, _X.fdx) remain incorrectly open.

I have a test showing it; fix is trivial.  Will post patch & commit shortly."

1,"After RepositoryImpl instance has been created and shut down, some classes cannot be unloadedI've built a simple web-application, which contains one servlet loaded at start-up. In its init() method an instance of RepositoryImpl() is created, in its destroy() method this instance is stopped (using shutdown()).
From the servlet code, only classes in jackrabbit-core, JCR API and Servlet API are referenced.
jackrabbit-core version is 1.4.5, and jackrabbit-jcr-commons version is 1.4.2. Other jackrabbit libs are all of 1.4 version.

Even if servlet's doGet() method never gets called, when the web-application is redeployed, all its classes still hang in memory, which produces a memory leak.

init() method is 

    public void init() throws ServletException {
        super.init();
        try {
            RepositoryConfig repoConfig = RepositoryConfig.create(getClass().getResourceAsStream(""repository.xml""), ""."");
            repo = RepositoryImpl.create(repoConfig);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            throw new ServletException(e);
        }
    }

while destroy() method is

    public void destroy() {
        repo.shutdown();
        super.destroy();
    }

Even when I applied patches from JCR-1636 and added TransientFileFactory.shutdown() call to destroy() method, nothing has changed.
Tested this in Jetty 6.1.9 and Tomcat 6.0.14."
1,"Missing support for lock timeout and ownerHint in jcr-servertrying to set the lock timeout when creating a lock seems not to work over the davex transport. the timeout is always 2147483.

import org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.RepositoryImpl;
import org.apache.jackrabbit.jcr2spi.config.RepositoryConfig;


String url = ""http://localhost:8080/server/"";
String workspace = ""tests"";

RepositoryConfig config = new RepositoryConfigImplTest(repoUrl);
Repository repo = RepositoryImpl.create(config);

Credentials sc = new SimpleCredentials(""admin"",""admin"".toCharArray());
Session s = repo.login(sc,workspace);

Node t;
if (s.getRootNode().hasNode(""test"")) {
    t = s.getRootNode().getNode(""test"");
} else {
    t = s.getRootNode().addNode(""test"", ""nt:unstructured"");
}
t.addMixin(""mix:lockable"");
s.save();
LockManager m = s.getWorkspace().getLockManager();
Lock l = m.lock(t.getPath(), false, true, 10, ""me"");
System.out.println(l.getSecondsRemaining());

and the output is 2147483

by the way: if i do not explicitly logout before the program exits, the lock is also not released even though it is session based. should the session not trigger a logout on destruction?"

1,"Merging implemented by codecs must catch aborted mergesThis is a regression (we lost functionality on landing flex).

When you close IW with ""false"" (meaning abort all running merges), IW asks the merge threads to abort.  The threads are supposed to periodically check if they are aborted and throw an exception if so.

But on the cutover to flex, where the codec can override how merging is done (but a default impl is in the base enum classes), we lost this."

Cookie.parse throws an exception because none of the four built-in formats

being parsed.

Resolution: If the value of the 'expires' parameter starts and ends with a

1,"getAllLinearVersions does not return the base versionIt appears that for a given linear version history, getAllLinearVersions returns less versions than getAllVersions -- the root version seems to be missing."
1,"WorkspaceImpl.dispose() might cause ClassNotFoundExceptionWenn using Jackrabbit in an environment, where ClassLoaders may get inactivated in the sense, the loading new classes is not possible anymore, shutting down the repository may result in a ClassNotFoundException during WorkspaceImpl.dispose().

Reason for this is, that in the dispose() method, the ObservationManager is asked for all registered event listeners for them to be removed from the ObservationManager one-by-one. Asking for the listeners results in a new EventListenerIteratorImpl object being created.

If now, this class has never been used during the live time of the repository, this would cause a ClassNotFoundException because the class loader is not laoding classes anymore in the specific environment.

The specific environment is Eclipse, where one plugin is managing different Repository instances provided by separate plugins. When now the Jackrabbit provider plugin has already been stopped while the managing plugin tries to shutdown the Jackrabbit repository, the EventListenerIteratorImpl class cannot be loaded anymore and disposing the WorkspaceImpl in a controlled way fails.

I suggest adding an ObservationManagerImpl.dispose() method, which is called by the WorkspaceImpl like :
    WorkspaceImpl.dispose() {
       if (obsMgr != null) {
         obsMgr.dispose();
         obsMgr = null;
        }
    }

As a side effect of not calling getObservationManager[Impl]() the observation manager would also not be created if not existing yet.

As a side effect to having the dispose method is, that the ObservationManagerImpl class could also do other cleanup work in addition to clearing the listener lists."
1,"Cluster revision entries should be retrieved in orderThe selectRevisionStmtSQL (DatabaseJournal#buildSqlStatements) returns a result set which may not be ordered by REVISION_ID. This has the effect that cluster instances that want to synchronize to the latest revision do not update their local revision appropriately since they assume that the revision result set is ordered (see code in AbstractJournal#doSync). This might cause a lot of unnecessary CPU cycles on these machines with degraded performance as a result. Furthermore, it causes functional issues as well as events may be fired multiple times and in the wrong order."
1,"Request/Response race condition when doing multiple requests on the same connection.If one tries to do multiple request over the same socket connection a race

<- Some: Headers
<- 
<- The body.

-- Next request -->
<- HTTP/1.1 200 OK
<- More: Headers
<- 
<- Some data.

If the second request is sent, but the second response isn't yet received

1,"There are a few binary search implmentations in lucene that suffer from a now well known overflow bughttp://googleresearch.blogspot.com/2006/06/extra-extra-read-all-about-it-nearly.html

MultiSearcher.subSearcher(int)
TermInfosReader.getIndexOffset(Term)
MultiSegmentReader.readerIndex(int, int[], int)
MergeDocIDRemapper.remap(int)

I havn't taken much time to consider how likely any of these are to overflow. The values being averaged would have to be very large. That would rule out possible problems for at least a couple of these, but how about something like the MergeDocIDRemapper? Is there a document number that could be reached that has a chance of triggering this bug? If not we can close this and have a record of looking into it."
1,"corrupted paths after moving nodeswe just found a bug which corrupts the results of Node.getPath() - it seems to be related to older Jackrabbit bugs (e.g. JCR-768) but still happens in jackrabbit 1.3 and jackrabbit-1.4-SNAPSHOT

Basically we have a node with 3 subnodes (a, b, c), we move all of them to index 1 - this works fine, unless we call getPath() of the third Node before moving it.

The expected paths after moving would be:
a: /pages[37]/page/element[3]
b: /pages[37]/page/element[2]
c: /pages[37]/page/element

But we get these paths:

a: /pages[37]/page/element[3]
b: /pages[37]/page/element
c: /pages[37]/page/element"
1,"Deadlocks in ConcurrentVersioningWithTransactionsTestPatch follows for a ConcurrentVersioningWithTransactionsTest, based on the existing ConcurrentVersioningTest but using transactions around the versioning operations.

Note that I had to ignore StaleItemStateException (which is probably justified, due to not locking stuff IIUC) to let the threads run long enough to show the problem.

1,"SpanOrQuery skipTo() doesn't always move forwardsIn SpanOrQuery the skipTo() method is improperly implemented if the target doc is less than or equal to the current doc, since skipTo() may not be called for any of the clauses' spans:

    public boolean skipTo(int target) throws IOException {
          if (queue == null) {
            return initSpanQueue(target);
          }

          while (queue.size() != 0 && top().doc() < target) {

          }
          
        	return queue.size() != 0;
        }

This violates the correct behavior (as described in the Spans interface documentation), that skipTo() should always move forwards, in other words the correct implementation would be:

    public boolean skipTo(int target) throws IOException {

1,"Security issue - DigestScheme uses constant nonce count valueThe nonce count value in DigestScheme is static (set to 00000001) and never changes.  (also seen as comment in said file).

This means that it fails against servers that correctly detect man-in-the-middle or replay attacks, leading to additional 401 requests (every second time), or such servers must be configured to turn such checks off (which is either poor security or poor for performance).

I suggest that at minimum, this count is incremented for every call to DigestScheme#createDigest.  It should also be an instance variable instead of a static, as it really relates to the challenge (assuming cases where instances are cached for reuse).  AtomicInteger is a good choice for implementing this counter.

The class of our own is just an intermediary which delays creating the Filter object...

{code}
@Override
public DocIdSet getDocIdSet(IndexReader reader) throws IOException {
            if (delegate == null) {
                delegate = factory.createFilter();
            }
            return delegate.getDocIdSet(reader);
}
{code}

Tracing through the code in CachingWrapperFilter, I can see that this NPE would occur if getDocIdSet() were to return null.

The Javadoc on Filter says that null will be returned if no documents will be accepted by the filter, but it doesn't seem that Lucene itself is handling null return values correctly, so which is correct?  The code or the Javadoc?  Supposing that null really is OK, does this cause any problems with how CachingWrapperFilter is implementing the caching?  I notice it's calling get() and then comparing against null so it wouldn't appear that it can distinguish ""the entry isn't in the cache"" from ""the entry is in the cache but it's null""."

1,"WeightedSpanTermExtractor incorrectly treats the same terms occurring in different query typesGiven a BooleanQuery with multiple clauses, if a term occurs both in a Span / Phrase query, and in a TermQuery, the results of term extraction are unpredictable and depend on the order of clauses. Concequently, the result of highlighting are incorrect.

Example text: t1 t2 t3 t4 t2
Example query: t2 t3 ""t1 t2""
Current highlighting: [t1 t2] [t3] t4 t2
Correct highlighting: [t1 t2] [t3] t4 [t2]

The problem comes from the fact that we keep a Map<termText, WeightedSpanTerm>, and if the same term occurs in a Phrase or Span query the resulting WeightedSpanTerm will have a positionSensitive=true, whereas terms added from TermQuery have positionSensitive=false. The end result for this particular term will depend on the order in which the clauses are processed.

My fix is to use a subclass of Map, which on put() always sets the result to the most lax setting, i.e. if we already have a term with positionSensitive=true, and we try to put() a term with positionSensitive=false, we set the result positionSensitive=false, as it will match both cases."

1,"When reopen returns a new IndexReader, both IndexReaders may now control the lifecycle of the underlying Directory which is managed by reference countingRough summary. Basically, FSDirectory tracks references to FSDirectory and when IndexReader.reopen shares a Directory with a created IndexReader and closeDirectory is true, FSDirectory's ref management will see two decrements for one increment. You can end up getting an AlreadyClosed exception on the Directory when the IndexReader is open.

I have a test I'll put up. A solution seems fairly straightforward (at least in what needs to be accomplished)."
1,"Wrong implementation of DocIdSetIterator.advance Implementations of {{DocIdSetIterator}} behave differently when advanced is called. Taking the following test for {{OpenBitSet}}, {{DocIdBitSet}} and {{SortedVIntList}} only {{SortedVIntList}} passes the test:
{code:title=org.apache.lucene.search.TestDocIdSet.java|borderStyle=solid}
...
	public void testAdvanceWithOpenBitSet() throws IOException {
		DocIdSet idSet = new OpenBitSet( new long[] { 1121 }, 1 );  // bits 0, 5, 6, 10
		assertAdvance( idSet );
	}

	public void testAdvanceDocIdBitSet() throws IOException {
		BitSet bitSet = new BitSet();
		bitSet.set( 0 );
		bitSet.set( 5 );
		bitSet.set( 6 );
		bitSet.set( 10 );
		DocIdSet idSet = new DocIdBitSet(bitSet);
		assertAdvance( idSet );
	}

	public void testAdvanceWithSortedVIntList() throws IOException {
		DocIdSet idSet = new SortedVIntList( 0, 5, 6, 10 );
		assertAdvance( idSet );
	}	

	private void assertAdvance(DocIdSet idSet) throws IOException {
		DocIdSetIterator iter = idSet.iterator();
		int docId = iter.nextDoc();
		assertEquals( ""First doc id should be 0"", 0, docId );

		docId = iter.nextDoc();
		assertEquals( ""Second doc id should be 5"", 5, docId );

		docId = iter.advance( 5 );
		assertEquals( ""Advancing iterator should return the next doc id"", 6, docId );
	}
{code}

The javadoc for {{advance}} says:
{quote}
Advances to the first *beyond* the current whose document number is greater than or equal to _target_.
{quote}
This seems to indicate that {{SortedVIntList}} behaves correctly, whereas the other two don't. 
Just looking at the {{DocIdBitSet}} implementation advance is implemented as:
{code}
bitSet.nextSetBit(target);
{code}
where the docs of {{nextSetBit}} say:
{quote}
Returns the index of the first bit that is set to true that occurs *on or after* the specified starting index

1,"Indexing configuration not refreshed after node type registrationThe indexing configuration has internal caches that speed up node type matches. Those caches are not updated on new node type registration and newly registered node types are not properly resolved when index-rules are checked.

See also test case in attached patch."
1,"Invalid behavior of StandardTokenizerImplThe following code prints the output of StandardAnalyzer:

        Analyzer analyzer = new StandardAnalyzer();
        TokenStream ts = analyzer.tokenStream(""content"", new StringReader(""<some text>""));
        Token t;
        while ((t = ts.next()) != null) {
            System.out.println(t);
        }

If you pass ""www.abc.com"", the output is (www.abc.com,0,11,type=<HOST>) (which is correct in my opinion).
However, if you pass ""www.abc.com."" (notice the extra '.' at the end), the output is (wwwabccom,0,12,type=<ACRONYM>).

I think the behavior in the second case is incorrect for several reasons:
1. It recognizes the string incorrectly (no argue on that).
2. It kind of prevents you from putting URLs at the end of a sentence, which is perfectly legal.
3. An ACRONYM, at least to the best of my understanding, is of the form A.B.C. and not ABC.DEF.

I looked at StandardTokenizerImpl.jflex and I think the problem comes from this definition:
// acronyms: U.S.A., I.B.M., etc.
// use a post-filter to remove dots
ACRONYM    =  {ALPHA} ""."" ({ALPHA} ""."")+

Notice how the comment relates to acronym as U.S.A., I.B.M. and not something else. I changed the definition to
ACRONYM    =  {LETTER} ""."" ({LETTER} ""."")+
and it solved the problem.

This was also reported here:

1,"IndexReader overwrites future commits when you open it on a past commitHit this on trying to build up a test index for perf testing...

IndexReader (and Writer) accept an IndexCommit on open.

This is quite powerful, because, if you use a deletion policy that keeps multiple commits around, you can open a not-current commit, make some changes, write a new commit, all without altering the ""future"" commits.

I use this to first build up a big wikipedia index, including one commit w/ multiple segments, then another commit after optimize(), and then I open an writable IR to perform deletions off of both those commits.  This gives me a single test index that has all four combinations (single vs multi segment; deletions vs no deletions).

But IndexReader has a bug whereby it overwrites the segments_N file.  (IndexWriter works correctly)."
1,Background text extraction not possible when supportHighlighting is set trueThere is an IndexingQueue that holds nodes that are indexed with a background thread when text extraction takes more time than a configurable limit. When supportHighlighting is set to true the IndexingQueue is never used because the text extract is immediately requested in NodeIndexer. Instead the text extract should be retrieved only when the node is added to the index.

The problem is that the thread that pulls the XML docs is started as
soon as EnwikiDocMaker class is instantiated.  When it's started, it
uses the fileIS (FileInputStream) to feed the XML Parser.  But,
openFile is actually called twice on starting the alg, if you use any
task deriving from ResetInputsTask, which closes the original fileIS
that the XML parser may be using.

I changed the thread to instead start on-demand the first time next()
is called.  I also removed a redundant resetInputs() call (which was
opening the file more frequently than needed).  Finally, I added logic
in the thread to detect that the input stream was closed (because
LineDocMaker.resetInputs() was called, eg, if we are not running the
doc maker to exhaustion).

1,"jcr2spi: Unprocessed ItemInfos call to RepositoryService#getItemInfosstefan reported the following problem:

- batchread config reads with depths infinity
- invalidate tree by calling Node.refresh(false)
- force loading of the tree (e.g. Node.getPath())

afterwards, there may still be invalidated item states indicating that not all ItemInfos were processed.
consequently, there are additional calls to getItemInfos that should have been covered by the loading of the tree.
the problem occuring is not related to limitation of the item-cache size.

problem analysis:

there is a bug in WorkspaceItemStateFactory#createItemStates.
there is a wrapper built around the ItemInfo-Iterator but later on the ItemInfo-Iterator is used instead of the wrapper, which pre-fetches items from the underlying iterator and process them upon hasNext()/next()."

   - Save the session (or alternatively save the parent of the new node)

1,"BitVector.isSparse is sometimes wrongIn working on LUCENE-3246, I found a few problems with
BitVector.isSparse:

  * Its math can overflow int, such that if there are enough deleted
    docs and maxDoc() is largish, isSparse may incorrectly return true

  * It over-estimates the size of the sparse file, since when
    estimating number of bytes for the vInt dgaps it uses bits.length
    instead of bits.length divided by number of set bits (ie, the
    ""average"" gap between set bits)

This is relatively harmless (just affects performance / size of .del
file on disk, not correctness).

1,"Cluster sync not always done when calling session.refresh(..)Session.refresh(..) is supposed to synchronize cluster changes, but this doesn't always happen, specially if the syncDelay is low. The reason is a wrong assumption in ClusterNode.sync: The code there to avoid duplicate sync calls doesn't always work as expected. The following algorithm is used:

        int count = syncCount;
        syncLock.acquire();
        if (count == syncCount) {
            journalSync();
            syncCount++;
        }

1,"always apply position increment gap between valuesI'm doing some fancy stuff with span queries that is very sensitive to term positions.  I discovered that the position increment gap on indexing is only applied between values when there are existing terms indexed for the document.  I suspect this logic wasn't deliberate, it's just how its always been for no particular reason.  I think it should always apply the gap between fields.  Reference DocInverterPerField.java line 82:

if (fieldState.length > 0)
          fieldState.position += docState.analyzer.getPositionIncrementGap(fieldInfo.name);

This is checking fieldState.length.  I think the condition should simply be:  if (i > 0).
I don't think this change will affect anyone at all but it will certainly help me.  Presently, I can either change this line in Lucene, or I can put in a hack so that the first value for the document is some dummy value which is wasteful."
1,"Possible concurrency bug with Workspace.copy() Hi,

Enclosed below is a test case that can be used to reproduce a
concurrency bug. This test case uses two con-current threads to
execute Workspace.copy() to copy a node to same destination. The
parent node has set its allowSameNameSiblings to false. According to
the javadoc of Workspace.copy(String srcAbsPath, String destAbsPath) :
""This method copies the node at srcAbsPath to the new location at
destAbsPath. If successful, the change is persisted immediately, there
is no need to call save."".  ""An ItemExistException is thrown if a
property already exists at destAbsPath or a node already exist there,
and same name siblings are not allowed. ""

However in reality this is not the case.  The test case can end up
with two child nodes with same names. Please note, not every run can
reproduce the problem, but generally I can get the problem within 3 to
10 iterations. I also got an InvalidItemStateException once (only
once).  Can someone kindly help to confirm if this is a bug in
Jackrabbit or maybe I am using JackRabbit in a wrong way? The test
case has been tested on Jackrabbit 1.6 branch
(http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/tags/1.6.0), Windows
Vista, JDK 1.5.0_14.

The test case is also attached for your convenience.

Thanks,
Jervis Liu

1,"exception during writeRequest leaves the connection un-releasedThe execute method has the following (simplified) flow:
1) get connection
2) write request
3) read result
4) release connection.
The release in step 4 happens when the input is completely read, which works fine.
If an exception occurs between steps 1 and 2, the connection is also released
properly.
However, if an exception occurs during step 2, the connection is never released
back and the connection manager eventually runs out of connections.

The easiest way to test this is to make a simple subclass of PostMethod that
overrides the writeRequest method:

public class TestConnectionReleaseMethod extends PostMethod
{
    protected void writeRequest(HttpState state, HttpConnection conn) throws
IOException, HttpException
    {
         throw new IOException(""for testing"");
    }

1,"DefaultHttpRequestRetryHandler must not retry non-idempotent http methods (violates RFC 2616)In DefaultHttpRequestRetryHandler, in case of NoHttpResponseException, the request is retried, without taking into account whether the http method is idempotent or not. This violates RFC 2616 section 8.1.4 which states :
{quote}
This means that clients, servers, and proxies MUST be able to recover
   from asynchronous close events. Client software SHOULD reopen the
   transport connection and retransmit the aborted sequence of requests
   without user interaction so long as the request sequence is
   idempotent (see section 9.1.2). Non-idempotent methods or sequences
   MUST NOT be automatically retried, although user agents MAY offer a
   human operator the choice of retrying the request(s).
{quote}

The fix is simple : at line 94, just remove the {{if (exception instanceof NoHttpResponseException) }} block. This way the idempotency of the method will be taken into account a bit further in the same method."
1,"Custom similarity is ignored when using MultiSearcherSymptoms:
I am using Searcher.setSimilarity() to provide a custom similarity that turns off tf() factor. However, somewhere along the way the custom similarity is ignored and the DefaultSimilarity is used. I am using MultiSearcher and BooleanQuery.

Problem analysis:
The problem seems to be in MultiSearcher.createWeight(Query) method. It creates an instance of CachedDfSource but does not set the similarity. As the result CachedDfSource provides DefaultSimilarity to queries that use it.

Potential solution:
Adding the following line:
    cacheSim.setSimilarity(getSimilarity());
after creating an instance of CacheDfSource (line 312) seems to fix the problem. However, I don't understand enough of the inner workings of this class to be absolutely sure that this is the right thing to do.

1,"SegmentReader.getFieldNames ignores FieldOption.DOC_VALUESwe use this getFieldNames api in segmentmerger if we merge something that isn't a SegmentReader (e.g. FilterIndexReader)

it looks to me that if you use a FilterIndexReader, call addIndexes(Reader...) the docvalues will be simply dropped.

I dont think its enough to just note that the field has docvalues either right? We need to also set the type 
correctly in the merged field infos? This would imply that instead of FieldOption.DOCVALUES, we need to have a 
FieldOption for each ValueType so that we correctly update the type.

But looking at FI.update/setDocValues, it doesn't look like we 'type-promote' here anyway?

This erases previous state established further up the filter chain, for example in the case where a custom filter wants to prevent a token from being stemmed. 

If a token is already marked as a keyword (KeywordAttribute.isKeyword() == true), perhaps the KeywordMarkerFilterFactory should not re-set the state to false."

The problem seems to lie in OutputContextImpl.java it makes the mistake of potentially trying to parse a Long as an Integer, here: http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/jackrabbit/trunk/jackrabbit-webdav/src/main/java/org/apache/jackrabbit/webdav/io/OutputContextImpl.java

in the method setContentLength(long contentLength):

public void setContentLength(long contentLength) {
       int length = Integer.parseInt(contentLength + """");
       if (length >= 0) {
           response.setContentLength(length);
       }
   }

I'm not sure, but a fix might be like this:

public void setContentLength(long contentLength) {
       if(contentLength <= Integer.MAX_VALUE && contentLength >= 0) {
           response.setContentLength((int) contentLength);
       }else if (contentLength >  Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
            response.addHeader(""Content-Length"", Long.toString(contentLength));
       }
   }

This would at least set the Content-Length header, and in some preliminary tests does seem to allow downloading the files."

1,"SharedFieldCache can cause a memory leakThe SharedFieldCache has some problems with the way it builds the cache:
 - as key is has the IndexReader
 - as value it has a inner cache (another map) that has as a key a static inner class called 'Key'.

This 'Key' holds a reference to the comparator used for in the queries ran.
Assuming this comparator is of any type that extends from AbstractFieldComparator (I think all of the custom JR comparators), then it keeps a reference to all the InderReader instances in order to be able to load the values as Comparable(s).

So the circle is complete and the SharedFieldCache entries never get GC'ed.

One option would have been to implement a 'purge' method on the cache, similar to the lucene mechanism, and when an InderReader gets closed is could call 'purge'. But that is both ugly AND is doesn't seem to work that well :)

A more radical option is to remove the cache completely. Each instance of SimpleFieldComparator (the only client of this cache) already builds an array of the available values, so the cache would only help other instances of the same type. We'll not analyze this further.

The proposed solution (patch will follow shortly) is to remove the Comparator reference from the Key class. 
It looks like it has no real purpose there, just to impact the 'equals' of the key, which makes no sense in the first place as the lucene query does not use the Comparator info at all.
If anything, using the same field and 2 different Comparators we'll get 2 different cache entries based on the same values from the lucene index.

Feedback is appreciated!

1,"QueryObjectModel does not generate the corresponding SQL2 Query when dealing with spaces in the pathThis is the original issue:
----------
I tried to get the childnodes of a node names ""/a b"" using the following code
  QueryManager queryManager=session.getWorkspace().getQueryManager();
  QueryObjectModelFactory qomf=queryManager.getQOMFactory();
  Source source1=qomf.selector(NodeType.NT_BASE, ""selector_0"");
  Column[] columns = new Column[]{qomf.column(""selector_0"", null, null)};
  Constraint constraint2 = qomf.childNode(""selector_0"", ""/a b"");
  QueryObjectModel qom = qomf.createQuery(source1, constraint2 , null, columns);

This is not giving any result when the session is acquired through webdav. But when connected using JNDI it is giving the child nodes. 

The sql statement getting created is 
SELECT selector_0.* FROM [nt:base] AS selector_0 WHERE ISCHILDNODE(selector_0, 
[/a b]).

When using webdav If i give this SQL2 query directly along with quotes around 
the path i.e. ['/a b'] then it is working as expected.
----------

this doesn't have anything to do with webdav. the problem is the QueryObjectModel generates an SQL2 query that is not 100% equivalent, it fails to escape paths that have spaces in them.
this way, in the case of davex remoting, the jr client will use the statement generated instead, which is not escaped, and will fail to return the expected nodes. 

This can be seen easily if we do a System.out.println(qom.getStatement())

1,"DefaultRequestDirector converts redirects of PUT/POST to GET for status codes 301, 302, 307The DefaultRequestDirector treats redirect requests created by all redirect status codes (HttpStatus.SC_MOVED_TEMPORARILY: , HttpStatus.SC_MOVED_PERMANENTLY, HttpStatus.SC_SEE_OTHER, HttpStatus.SC_TEMPORARY_REDIRECT) the same, converting PUT/POST methods to GET.  The HttpClient Tutorial even documents this as being in accordance with the specification, but I don't believe that's true.

Per the RFC (http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html), conversion of PUT/POST to GET is appropriate only for 303 (See Other).  The others do not suggest this behavior.  In fact, the following notes attached to them call it out as incorrect.

301 (Moved Permanently) has this note:

      Note: When automatically redirecting a POST request after
      receiving a 301 status code, some existing HTTP/1.0 user agents
      will erroneously change it into a GET request.

And 302 (Found) say this:

      Note: RFC 1945 and RFC 2068 specify that the client is not allowed
      to change the method on the redirected request.  However, most
      existing user agent implementations treat 302 as if it were a 303
      response, performing a GET on the Location field-value regardless
      of the original request method. The status codes 303 and 307 have
      been added for servers that wish to make unambiguously clear which
      kind of reaction is expected of the client.

The currently implemented behavior is causing problems with interacting with Central Authentication Service protected resources, among other things."
1,"Preemptive auth flags disregarded during ssl tunnel creationUsing a Squid2.4 proxy, the connection is dropped when trying to connect to a

down to where the ssl tunnel is created in HttpMethodDirectors executeConnect

flags set as parameters are not being set on the new ConnectMethod object.

Basically, SpanQueries aren't really queries, you just get one scorer. it calls extractTerms on the whole hierarchy and computes weights (e.g. IDF) on
the whole bag of terms, even if they don't exist.

This is fine, we already have tests that sim's won't bug-out in computeStats() here: however they don't expect to actually score documents based on
these terms that don't exist... however this is exactly what happens in Spans because it doesn't use sub-scorers.

It's an intermittant failure that only happens when multiple threads
are calling commit() at once.  With autoComit=true and
ConcurrentMergeScheduler, this can happen more often because each
merge thread calls commit after it's done.

The problem happens when one thread has already begun the commit
process, but another two or more threads then come along wanting to
also commit after further changes have happened.  Those two or more
threads would wait until the currently committing thread finished, and
then they'd wake up and do their commit.  The problem was, after
waking up they would fail to check whether they had been superseded,
ie whether another thread had already committed more up-to-date
changes.

The fix is simple -- after waking up, check again if your commit has
been superseded, and skip your commit if so.

That is a significant loss of information, since xml:base, xml:lang, and xml:id attributes are critical to the content.  We should register the xml prefix as a reserved namespace (not needing an xmlns declaration) and then treat it like any other attribute.

1,"jcr:frozenUuid does not contain jcr:contentWhen I store versionable files, I get problems retrieving the jcr:data from a custom node type.

I am storing a node type:

        pd: xrc:MimeType
        pd: jcr:mixinTypes
        pd: xrc:Description

        pd: jcr:encoding
        pd: jcr:mimeType
        pd: jcr:lastModified
        pd: jcr:primaryType

So I commit the changes, then later pull up the version and get it's frozenNode.

Node frozenNode = v.getNode(JcrConstants.JCR_FROZENNODE);

And then I return all of the properties contained within:

PropertyIterator pi = frozenNode.getProperties();
                while (pi.hasNext()) {
                    System.out.println(pi.nextProperty().getName());
}


All that are returned are:

jcr:frozenUuid
jcr:uuid
jcr:frozenPrimaryType
jcr:frozenMixinTypes
jcr:primaryType

Here is the frozen node type:

nt:frozenNode
        pd: *
        pd: *
        pd: jcr:frozenUuid
        pd: jcr:uuid
        pd: jcr:mixinTypes
        pd: jcr:frozenPrimaryType
        pd: jcr:frozenMixinTypes
        pd: jcr:primaryType



So basically it would seem that the recursive copy inside the InternalFrozenNodeImpl is not working. But it seems that is not the case from the code trace I did. Add this to line 368 of InternalFrozenNodeImpl.java

System.out.println(""New node created. Props: "");
        try {
            PropertyState [] ps = node.getProperties();
            for (PropertyState p : ps) {
                System.out.println(p.getName());
                System.out.println(p.toString());
            }
            NodeStateEx [] ns = node.getChildNodes();
            for (NodeStateEx n : ns) {
                System.out.println(n.getName());
                System.out.println(n.toString());
            }
        } catch (ItemStateException e) {
            // TODO Auto-generated catch block
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

1,"LuceneTaxonomyReader .decRef() may close the inner IR, renderring the LTR in a limbo.TaxonomyReader which supports ref-counting, has a decRef() method which delegates to an inner IndexReader and calls its .decRef(). The latter may close the reader (if the ref is zeroes) but the taxonomy would remain 'open' which will fail many of its method calls.

Also, the LTR's .close() method does not work in the same manner as IndexReader's - which calls decRef(), and leaves the real closing logic to the decRef(). I believe this should be the right approach for the fix."

After checkin though the implementation tries to access the string value of the jcr:uuid property, which is not existing, hence the internal property implementation throws the exception when accessing the first element in the empty value array.

1,"Using WildcardQuery with MultiSearcher, and Boolean MUST_NOT clauseWe are searching across multiple indices using a MultiSearcher. There seems to be a problem when we use a WildcardQuery to exclude documents from the result set. I attach a set of unit tests illustrating the problem.

In these tests, we have two indices. Each index contains a set of documents with fields for 'title',  'section' and 'index'. The final aim is to do a keyword search, across both indices, on the title field and be able to exclude documents from certain sections (and their subsections) using a
WildcardQuery on the section field.
 
 e.g. return documents from both indices which have the string 'xyzpqr' in their title but which do not lie
 in the news section or its subsections (section = /news/*).
 
The first unit test (testExcludeSectionsWildCard) fails trying to do this.
 If we relax any of the constraints made above, tests pass:
 
* Don't use WildcardQuery, but pass in the news section and it's child section to exclude explicitly (testExcludeSectionsExplicit)</li>
* Exclude results from just one section, not it's children too i.e. don't use WildcardQuery(testExcludeSingleSection)</li>

1,"Extend mimetype list of text extractorsDo you think it would be possible to extend the mimetype list of the
MsPowerpoint and MsExcel textextractors with ""application/powerpoint"" and
""application/excel""? 

It just took me half an hour to figure out why my
documents didn't turn up in a jackrabbit fulltext-search and maybe other
users might run into the same problem...

I'm not sure if there is some kind of standard which lists the possible
default mimetypes but after a quick google search it seems to me that they
are not that uncommon.

1,"Fix and simplify CryptedSimpleCredentialsthe credentials retrieved from UserImpl and used to validate the simplecredentials passed to the repository login is overly complex
and buggy as it tries to match all kind credentials variants with and without hashed password.
in particular it contains the following problems:
- simplecredentials containing the hashed pw are considered valid
- passwords startign with {something} cause inconsistencies and may even prevent the user from login

it should be improved as follows:
- simplecredentials are always expected to contain the plain text password both for creation and
  comparison with the cryptedsimplecredentials.
- creating cryptedsimplecredentials from uid/pw however is left unchanged: the specified pw is
  hashed with the default algorithm if it turns out not to be in the hashed format.
- in addition the pw should also be hashed if it has the form {something}whatever but something
  is an invalid algorithm.

1,"KeywordTokenizer does not properly set the end offsetKeywordTokenizer sets the Token's term length attribute but appears to omit the end offset. The issue was discovered while using a highlighter with the KeywordAnalyzer. KeywordAnalyzer delegates to KeywordTokenizer propagating the bug. 

Below is a JUnit test (source is also attached) that exercises various analyzers via a Highlighter instance. Every analyzer but the KeywordAnazlyzer successfully wraps the text with the highlight tags, such as ""<b>thetext</b>"". When using KeywordAnalyzer the tags appear before the text, for example: ""<b></b>thetext"". 

Please note NewKeywordAnalyzer and NewKeywordTokenizer classes below. When using NewKeywordAnalyzer the tags are properly placed around the text. The NewKeywordTokenizer overrides the next method of the KeywordTokenizer setting the end offset for the returned Token. NewKeywordAnalyzer utilizes KeywordTokenizer to produce proper token.

Unless there is an objection I will gladly post a patch in the very near future .

1,"Authentication fails with proxied SSL ConnectionsWhen connecting through a proxy, using SSL and authentication HttpClient winds 
up sending a GET request to the proxy after the initial auth required response, 
the proxy then obviously responds with a not implemented response since it 
can't handle a GET request to an SSL URL.  In essence the following is 
happening:

1. HttpClient sends Connect response.
2. Proxy responds 200 Connect OK
3. HttpClient uses SSL connection to send the request to the web server.
4. Web server responds with not authorized and closes the connection.
5. HttpClient opens a new connection to the proxy and issues a GET request for 
the SSL URL.
6. Proxy returns 501 not implemented.

I'll attach a full log to this bug.

This is likely to be hard to fix since the retry is performed in HttpMethodBase 
but the Connect method is executed by HttpClient so a fix for this may be best 
waiting for 2.1.  This looks very similar to HTTPCLIENT-195 except that that bug is 
marked as fixed and this one still doesn't work, this also applies to 
authentication schemes other than NTLM (testing NTLM and basic).

My best evaluation is that the web server returns Connection: close when it 
rejects the authorization attempt and then HttpMethodBase is incapable of 
creating a new SSL connection through the proxy.  The only thing I can think of 
that could be done prior to 2.1 to fix this is to send a Connection: keep-alive 
as well as the Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive we're already sending with the 
original request."

1,"save() might create new transient propertiesIt seems that when a new node is saved through the parent node, new properties might get created, which are not saved. To persist those properties the new node must be saved again.

Example:

(Consider a mixin type ""extVer"" extending the standard type mix:versionable.)

      Node node = parent.addNode(""newNode"", ""nt:base"");
      node.addMixin(""extVer"");
      // ""mix:versionable"" properties do not exist here
      
      // save the new node
      parent.save();

      // now ""mix:versionable"" properties like ""jcr:isCheckedOut""
      // exist in the ""node"" but:
      //    node.getProperty(""jcr:isCheckedOut"").isNew() == true
      // fix:
      node.save();

If the last node.save() opertation would not be done, a RepositoryException would result if a node.checkIn() would be done immediately after parent.save().

This seems counterintuitive and seems like an error. I wonder whether the properties should not be added upon ""node.addMixin"" ? At least ""parent.save()"" should (or might I say must ?) not only add the properties but also save them."

1,"Be consistent about negative vInt/vLongToday, write/readVInt ""allows"" a negative int, in that it will encode and decode correctly, just horribly inefficiently (5 bytes).

However, read/writeVLong fails (trips an assert).

I'd prefer that both vInt/vLong trip an assert if you ever try to write a negative number... it's badly trappy today.  But, unfortunately, we sometimes rely on this... had we had this assert in 'since the beginning' we could have avoided that.

So, if we can't add that assert in today, I think we should at least fix readVLong to handle negative longs... but then you quietly spend 9 bytes (even more trappy!)."

1,"IndexWriter can flush too early when flushing by RAM usageThere is a silly bug in how DocumentsWriter tracks its RAM usage:
whenever term vectors are enabled, it incorrectly counts the space
used by term vectors towards flushing, when in fact this space is
recycled per document.

This is not a functionality bug.  All it causes is flushes to happen
too frequently, and, IndexWriter will use less RAM than you asked it
to.  To work around it you can simply give it a bigger RAM buffer.

1,DWFlushControl does not take active DWPT out of the loop on fullFlushWe have seen several OOM on TestNRTThreads and all of them are caused by DWFlushControl missing DWPT that are set as flushPending but can't full due to a full flush going on.

Even further we currently stall on the maxNumThreadStates while we should stall on the num of active thread states. I will attach a patch tomorrow.
1,"relative URIs with internal double-slashes ('//') misparsedURI.parseUriReference()'s heuristic for interpreting URI parts is thrown off by relative URIs which include an internal '//'. As a result, portions of the supplied relative URI (path) can be lost. 

For example:

URI rel = new URI(""foo//bar//baz"");
rel.toString();
(java.lang.String) //bar//baz

The culprit seems to be line 1961 of URI improperly concluding that two slashes later than the beginning of 'tmp' are still indicative the URI is a 'net_path'. 

A possible quick fix might be to add a '!isStartedFromPath &&' to the beginning of the line 1961 test, making the line:

            if (!isStartedFromPath && at + 2 < length && tmp.charAt(at + 1) == '/') {

... and thus preventing the misguided authority-parsing from happening when earlier analysis already identified the current string as a strictly path-oriented URI.

(It also appears the setting of the is_net_path boolean at the end of this if's block may be wrong; this code is run for hier_path URIs that are not net_paths in the 2396 syntax. For example:

URI uri = new URI(""http://www.example.com/some/page"");
uri.isNetPath();
 (boolean) true

procedure times out after 5 seconds as expected:
        SocketAddress addr = new InetSocketAddress(""192.168.254.1"", 80);
        try {
            
            SocketChannel channel = SocketChannel.open();
            channel.socket().connect(addr, 5000);            
            System.out.println(""connected"");
            
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }"
1,"QueryParser.getFieldQuery(String,String) doesn't set default slop on MultiPhraseQuerythere seems to have been an oversight in calling mph.setSlop(phraseSlop) in QueryParser.getFieldQuery(String,String).  The result being that in some cases, the ""default slop"" value doesnt' get set right (sometimes, ... see below).

when i tried amending TestMultiAnalyzer to demonstrate the problem, I discovered that the grammer aparently always calls getFieldQuery(String,String,int) -- even if no ""~slop"" was specified in the text being parsed, in which case it passes the default as if it were specified.
(just to clarify: i haven't comfirmed this from a detailed reading of the grammer/code, it's just what i've deduced based on observation of the test)

The problem isn't entirely obvious unless you have a subclasses of QueryParser and try to call getFieldQuery(String,String) directly.   

In my case, I had overridden getFieldQuery(String,String) to call super.getFieldQuery(String,String) and wrap the result in a DisjunctionMaxQuery ... I don't care about supporting the ~slop syntax, but i do care about the default slop and i wasn't getting lucky the way QueryParser does, because getFieldQuery(String,String,int) wasn't getting back something it could call setSlop() with the (default) value it got from the javacc generated code.

My description may not make much sense, but hopefull the test patch i'm about to attach will.  The fix is also in the patch, and is fairly trivial.

(disclaimer: i don't have javacc installed, so I tested this patch by manually making the change to both QueryParser.java ... it should only be commited by someone with javacc who can regen the java file and confirm that my jj change doesn't have some weird bug in it)



"
1,"Redirection of a POST methodI execute a PostMethod to an URL which redirects me to a HTML page. If I set 
follow redirects to true the HttpClient wants to execute once more a POST. Of 
course a POST is not allowed to HTML pages. I think the HttpClient should 
exectue a GET method instead. That's also what is in the RFC2616:

10.3 Redirection 3xx

   This class of status code indicates that further action needs to be
   taken by the user agent in order to fulfill the request.  The action
   required MAY be carried out by the user agent without interaction
   with the user if and only if the method used in the second request is
   GET or HEAD. A client SHOULD detect infinite redirection loops, since
   such loops generate network traffic for each redirection.

      Note: previous versions of this specification recommended a
      maximum of five redirections. Content developers should be aware
      that there might be clients that implement such a fixed
      limitation."
1,"literal plus (+) character in path components of HttpURL is not preserved.When a literal plus character is included in the path component of an URL, it is
not encoded, but get decoded during getPath() to a space.

Reproducible with the following:

HttpURL httpURL = new HttpURL(""http://localhost/test+test"");
System.out.println(httpURL.getPath());

Output:
""test test""

The following path fixes the issue (This patch does not appear to break anything
 else):

1,"Cluster Node ID should be trimmedIf the cluster node ID is not configured in repository.xml, it is read from the file cluster_node.id instead. In case this file is edited by hand, some editors (e.g. vi) insert a trailing newline character (""\n""). This leads to the cluster node ID to contain a blank character. While I don't expect this to cause any issues, it is inconvenient for debugging and also introduces line-breaks in log files. I suggest to trim the cluster node ID, so only non-blank characters are used."

1,"DocumentsWriter blocks flushes when applyDeletes takes forever - memory not releasedIn DocumentsWriter we have a safety check that applies all deletes if the deletes consume too much RAM to prevent too-frequent flushing of a long tail of tiny segments. If we enter applyAllDeletes we essentially lock on IW -> BufferedDeletes which is fine since this usually doesn't take long and doesn't keep DWPTs from indexing. Yet, if that takes long and at the same time a semgent is flushed and subsequently published to the IW we take the lock on the ticket queue and the IW. Now this prevents all other threads to append to the ticketQueue which is done BEFORE we actually flush the segment concurrently and free up the RAM.

Essentially its ok to block on the IW lock but we should not keep concurrent flushed from execution just because we apply deletes. The threads will block once they try to execute maybeMerge after the segment is flushed so we don't pile up subsequent memory but we should actually allow the DWPT to be flushed since we actually try to get rid of memory.

I ran into this by accident due to a coding bug using delete queries instead of terms for each document. This thread dump show the problem:

1,"Issue while loading list of classes at that path itself.Hi,

I cannot retrieve list of objects that are directly under the path that they were saved in. I did not know where to simulate this issue and hence I have used DigesterSimpleQueryTest. I have attached the path for the newly added test case testObjectListRetrievalAtBasePath. In case the patch is not up to the mark I have attached the modified file too.

Instead of creating Page in /test if I create it in /sample/test and search in /sample/test it returns nothing but if I search in /sample it would return the object.

Another important point here is that it is causing issues while retrieving Page class, the other test cases that are retrieving Paragraph class (embedded inside Page class) are still working fine!

i have to unnecessarily specify username & password, because the MSSqlFileSystem presets them to an empty string instead of null. funnily enough  the tableSpace is preset to null, which leads to a nullpointer in createSchemaSql

1,"DbInputStream does not support mark()/reset() when exhausted.The DbDataStore implementation uses a DbInputStream to read binary properties from the database. When a new binary property is created, Jackrabbit attempts to index it. Tika's CharsetDetector is used in the process, which marks the input stream, reads the first 8000 bytes and then resets the stream.

This results in the stacktrace shown at the end of the issue, if the following two conditions hold true:
* the property is larger than the minRecordLength configuration of the Datastore and
* the property is smaller than 8000 bytes

The DbInputStream needs to have the following properties:
1. lazy instantiation of the underlying stream
2. auto-close underlying stream when EOF is reached
3. fully support mark()/reset() even if  the underlying stream is auto-closed due to 2.

1,"BooleanQuery explain with boost==0BooleanWeight.explain() uses the returned score of subweights to determine if a clause matched.
If any required clause has boost==0, the returned score will be zero and the explain for the entire BooleanWeight will be simply  Explanation(0.0f, ""match required"").

I'm not sure what the correct fix is here.  I don't think it can be done based on score alone, since that isn't how scorers work.   Perhaps we need a new method ""boolean Explain.matched()"" that returns true on a match, regardless of what the score may be? 

Related to the problem above, even if no boosts are zero, it it sometimes nice to know *why* a particular query failed to match.  It would mean a longer explanation, but maybe we should include non matching explains too?"

1,Benchmark deletes.alg failsBenchmark deletes.alg fails because the index reader defaults to open readonly.  
1,"Lucene fails to close file handles under certain situationsAs a followon to LUCENE-820, I've added a further check in
MockRAMDirectory to assert that there are no open files when the
directory is closed.

That check caused a few unit tests to fail, and in digging into the
reason I uncovered these cases where Lucene fails to close file
handles:

  * TermInfosReader.close() was setting its ThreadLocal enumerators to
    null without first closing the SegmentTermEnum in there.  It looks
    like this was part of the fix for LUCENE-436.  I just added the
    call to close.

    This is somewhat severe since we could leak many file handles for
    use cases that burn through threads and/or indexes.  Though,
    FSIndexInput does have a finalize() to close itself.

  * Flushing of deletes in IndexWriter opens SegmentReader to do the
    flushing, and it correctly calls close() to close the reader.  But
    if an exception is hit during commit and before actually closing,
    it will leave open those handles.  I fixed this first calling
    doCommit() and then doClose() in a finally.  The ""disk full"" tests
    we now have were hitting this.

  * IndexWriter's addIndexes(IndexReader[]) method was opening a
    reader but not closing it with a try/finally.  I just put a
    try/finally in.

I've also changed some unit tests to use MockRAMDirectory instead of
RAMDirectory to increase testing coverage of ""leaking open file
handles"".

Points all around the globe, plus two points at 0, 179.9 and 0,-179.9 (on each side of the meridian).  Then, do a Cartesian Tier filter on a point right near those two.  It will return all the points when it should just return those two.

The flawed logic is in the else clause below:
{code}

		if (longX == 0.0) {

-> At the moment there is no good upgrade path to move a repo to the bundled structure, the paths provided thus far are shaky at best.

separate stringpart or binarypart AND contain non-ascii characters in their property name.

from what i've seen this is due to a limitation in HttpClient 3.x Part#sendDispositionHeader that always writes the part name
as ascii-bytes. in a related discussion [1] specification compliance and usability were addressed.

looking at the server-side part revealed that org.apache.commons.fileupload.FileUploadBase#FileItemIteratorImpl
is prepared to receive non-ascii characters in a header value.
a simple test also showed that curl is perfectly able to send utf-8 part names.

based on this information and given the fact that spi2dav and the server-sided part are intended to communicate
with one other rather than with any kind of custom clients, i suggest to add a simple fix by patching the parts used
within spi2davex.

btw: in HttpClient 4.x there seems to be a workaround for this problem [2]

1,"CloseableThreadLocal does not work well with Tomcat thread poolingWe tracked down a large memory leak (effectively a leak anyway) caused
by how Analyzer users CloseableThreadLocal.
CloseableThreadLocal.hardRefs holds references to Thread objects as
keys.  The problem is that it only frees these references in the set()
method, and SnowballAnalyzer will only call set() when it is used by a
NEW thread.

The problem scenario is as follows:

The server experiences a spike in usage (say by robots or whatever)
and many threads are created and referenced by
CloseableThreadLocal.hardRefs.  The server quiesces and lets many of
these threads expire normally.  Now we have a smaller, but adequate
thread pool.  So CloseableThreadLocal.set() may not be called by
SnowBallAnalyzer (via Analyzer) for a _long_ time.  The purge code is
never called, and these threads along with their thread local storage
(lucene related or not) is never cleaned up.

I think calling the purge code in both get() and set() would have
avoided this problem, but is potentially expensive.  Perhaps using 
WeakHashMap instead of HashMap may also have helped.  WeakHashMap 
purges on get() and set().  So this might be an efficient way to
clean up threads in get(), while set() might do the more expensive
Map.keySet() iteration.

Our current work around is to not share SnowBallAnalyzer instances
among HTTP searcher threads.  We open and close one on every request.

Thanks,

1,"JCR-SQL2 query with multiple columns in result only returns last column when using Row.getValues()When running a query like below on an in-process repository (via TransientRepository) or via RMI access, a call to Row.getValues() only returns the last column selected:

       SELECT property1, property2 FROM [nodetype]

QueryResult.getColumnNames() returns the right set of columns.

Stepping through the code shows that org.apache.jackrabbit.core.query.lucene.join.AbstractRow has the implementation of getValues() - this creates a new Values array, then overwrites it multiple times in a for loop that iterates once per column. That doesn't sound like the desired behaviour.

Getting values via individual calls to Row.getValue(""property1"") gives the correct results.

1,"DBDataStore doesn't support concurrent readsMy understanding is that setting parameter copyWhenReading to true should allow concurrent reads by spooling binary property to temporary file and free database resources (connection) immediately to make it available for other threads.

After applying patch for JCR-1388, DBDataStore doesn't support concurrent reads anymore, resultSet is kept open and db connection is blocked until the stream is read and closed. When copyWhenReading is set to true db connection should be released immediately, this is the reason i guess why temporary file is used."

I dug for a while... the test is a bit sneaky because it compares sorted docs (by score) across 2 indexes.  Index #1 has no deletions; Index #2 has same docs, but organized into doc blocks by group, and has some deletions.  In theory (I think) even though the deletions will cause scores to differ across the two indices, it should not alter the sort order of the docs.  Here is the explain output of the docs that sorted differently:

Obviously, the latter condition is true from the very beginning. Replacing '>' with '<' or '<=' should do the trick."
1,I/O exceptions can cause loss of buffered deletesSome I/O exceptions that result in segmentInfos rollback operations can cause buffered deletes that existed before the rollback creation point to be incorrectly lost when the IOException triggers a rollback.
1,"Deadlock case in IndexWriter on exception just before flushIf a document hits a non-aborting exception, eg something goes wrong
in tokenStream.next(), and, that document had triggered a flush

exception.

I have a simple test case showing this, and a fix fixing it."
1,"ZombieHierarchyManager can return wrong child node entries for replaced nodesThe ZombieHierarchyManager currently implements the two getChildNodeEntry methods like this:

1) look up child node in old, overlayed state, which might contain removed child nodes
2) if not found, ask the super implementation (ie. get the child node from the up-to-date list)

The purpose of the ZombieHM is to be able to return removed item ids from the attic. However, the behavior above is IMO wrong, as it should first find an existing child node with the given name (or id):

1) look up child node in super implementation (ie. get the child node from the up-to-date list)
2) if not found, look in the old, overlayed state if it might have been removed

I was able to reproduce this issue when replacing a node (but note the custom access manager in 1.4.x used as explained below): create /replaced/subnode structure, save the session, remove the replaced node and add /replaced and then /replaced/subnode again:

        Node rootNode = session.getRootNode();
        
        // 1. create structure /replaced/subnode
        Node test = rootNode.addNode(""replaced"", NT);
        test.addNode(""subnode"", NT);
        // 2. persist changes
        session.save();

        // 3. remove node and recreate it
        test.remove();
        test = rootNode.addNode(""replaced"", NT);
        
        // 4. create previous child with same name
        test.addNode(""subnode"", NT);
        
        // 5. => gives exception
        test.getNode(""subnode"").getNodes();

To complicate things further, this was only triggered by a custom access manager, and all based upon Jackrabbit 1.4.x. Back then (pre-1.5 and new security stuff era), the access manager would get a ZombieHM as its hierarchy manager. If its implementation called resolvePath() on the HM for checking read-access in the final getNodes() call, where the tree will be traversed using the getChildNdeEntry(NodeState, Name, int) method, it would get the old node id and hence fail if it would try to retrieve it from the real item state manager.

Thus with a Jackrabbit >= 1.5 and 2.0 the above code will work fine, because the ZombieHM is not used.

However, we might want to fix it for 1.4.x and also check the other uses of the ZombieHM in the current trunk, which I couldn't test. These are (explicit and implicit): ChangeLogBasedHierarchyMgr, SessionItemStateManager.getDescendantTransientItemStates(NodeId), ItemImpl.validateTransientItems(Iterable<ItemState>, Iterable<ItemState>) and SessionItemStateManager.getDescendantTransientItemStatesInAttic(NodeId).

Right now CheckIndex claims the index is corrupt if you index a Token with -1 position, which happens if your first token has positionIncrementGap set to 0.

But, as far as I can tell, Lucene doesn't ""mind"" when this happens.

So I plan to fix CheckIndex to allow this case.  I'll backport to 2.3.2 as well.

1,"JCR Server has concurrency issues on JcrWebdavServer.SessionCache internal HashMap cachesAfter doing the davex remoting performance work outlined in JCR-3026, the increased concurrency on my jcr server exposed a lot of errors related to getting and putting from the JcrWebdavServer.SessionCache's internal HashMap's.  This problem with HashMap's is a well known concurrency error and was easily fixed by upgrading these maps to ConcurrentHashMaps.  Performance seems dramatically better.  

The fix includes exposure of a tuning parameter that allows the user to set the expected concurrency level.  This is the number of concurrent requests you expect the server to be handling.  In the typical davex remoting scenario, this means you should tune this server side value to match the total max connections of all clients pointed at the server.  See JCR-3026.

"
1,"ChangeLog serialization causes cache inconsistenciesThe ordering of actions is taken into account when a ChangeLog is built through session manipulations (see, for instance,  ChangeLog.deleted(ItemState state)). When it is serialized in ClusterNode.write(Record record, ChangeLog changeLog, EventStateCollection esc), however, this implicit ordering might be changed. As a consequence,  the deserialization in ClusterNode.consume(Record record) might produce a different ChangeLog with the effect that the local caches get out-of-sync with the persistent state of the repository.

The issue should be reproducable as follows:
- Setup a clustered environment with two Jackrabbit instances, say A and B.
- On instance A add a property ""P"" with value ""x"" to some node and save the session.
- On instance B read property ""P"" -> it will have value ""x"".
- On instance A delete property P and then add it again with value ""y"" and save the session.
- On instance B read property ""P"" -> it will still have value ""x"" after the cluster sync..."
1,"incorrect definition of built-in node type nt:hierarchyNodethe property jcr:created of nt:hierarchyNode should be non-mandatory according to the specification (jcr 1.0 and jcr 1.0.1).

1,"JCA Concurrent Modification Exception when JCAManagedConnection.cleanup() calledThe JCAManagedConnection.closeHandles() method causes a ConcurrentModificationException if the handles list is not empty.
This is caused by modification of the handles list by removeHandle(), while closeHandles() is iterating over the list.

Under SunOne AppServer 7 this can be caused simply by not closing the Session handle before the transaction commits.

It is probably not even necessary to send connectionClosed events during cleanup().  According to the API for connectionClosed, the event indicates that an application component has closed  the connection handle.  cleanup() is a container initiated action, and so the connectionClosed event is not applicable.

1,"If there is more than 15 seconds between HttpClient.execute() calls using a MultipartEntity, a ProtocolException is thrown complaining about the Content-Length header already being present.I am not sure if this time-related behaviour is intentional or not (I have only been using this library for a few weeks) , but even if a timeout is to be expected, the exception thrown ought to indicate that there is a time component involved.

1,"Inconsistent scoring with SpanTermQuery in BooleanQueryWhen a SpanTermQuery is added to a BooleanQuery, incorrect results are

I am running Lucene 1.9 RC1 on Windows XP.  I have a test case which has

    ID:1 (score:0.3884282)
    ID:4 (score:0.1942141)

Notice how it only returned two documents instead of four.  And the two it did 
return have differing scores.

I believe that there is an error in the scoring algorithm that is making the 
other two documents not show up."
1,"Several Codecs use the same files - PerFieldCodecWrapper can not hold two codec using the same filesCurrently we have a rather simple file naming scheme which prevents us from using more than one codec in a segment that relies on the same file.  For instance pulsing and standard codec can not be used together since they both need the .frq .tii .tis etc. To make this work we either need to write distinct per codec files or set a per field / codec file ID. While the first solution seems to be quiet verbose the second one seems to be more flexible too.

One possibility to do that would be to assign a unique id to each SegmentsWriteState when opening the FieldsConsumer and write the IDs into the segments file to eventually load it once the segment is opened. Otherwise our PerFieldCodec feature will not be really flexible nor useful though.  "
1,"Constants.LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION is inlined in code compiled against Lucene JAR, so version detection is incorrectWhen you compile your own code against the Lucene 2.9 version of the JARs and use the LUCENE_MAIN_VERSION constant and then run the code against the 3.0 JAR, the constant still contains 2.9, because javac inlines primitives and Strings into the class files if they are public static final and are generated by a constant (not method).

The attached fix will fix this by using a ident(String) functions that return the String itsself to prevent this inlining.

Will apply to 2.9, trunk and 2.9 BW branch. No I can also reenable one test I removed because of this."
1,"Deadlock for some Query objects in the equals method (f.ex.

1,"User-Agent string violates RFCOur User-Agent says ""Jakarta Commons-HttpClient/3.1-rc1"". But space is a reserved character to separate individual *products* and comments according to RFC 2616, section 14.43. Jakarta is not a product. At the same time we may want to drop the Jakarta name altogether.

We should change this to something more standard like: 

""Apache-HttpClient/3.1-rc1 (""+ System.getProperty(""os.name"") +"";""+ System.getProperty(""os.arch"") +"") ""+
""Java/""+ System.getProperty(""java.vm.version"") +"" (""+ System.getProperty(""java.vm.vendor"") +"")""

which renders:

""Apache-HttpClient/3.1-rc1 (Windows XP 5.1;x86) Java/1.5.0_08 (Sun Microsystems Inc.)""

Sun's internal Http client uses something like ""Java/1.5.0_08"".

I am completely ignoring the fact that real-world user agents use almost arbitrary strings.
Some fine examples of misbehaviour from my private logs:

""Jakmpqes dihurxf wfyiupsc"" -- apparently somebody has to hide something...
""Missigua Locator 1.9""
""Poodle predictor 1.0""
""shelob v1.0""
""ISC Systems iRc Search 2.1""
""ping.blogug.ch aggregator 1.0""
""http://www.uni-koblenz.de/~flocke/robot-info.txt""  -- ...sigh

I am very tempted to write a User-Agent string validator that prevents misuse of this field in HttpClient."

1,"Highlight fragment does not extend to maxDocCharsToAnalyzeThe current highlighter code checks whether the total length of the text to highlight is strictly smaller than maxDocCharsToAnalyze before adding any text remaining after the last token to the fragment. This means that if maxDocCharsToAnalyse is set to exactly the length of the text and the last token of the text is the term to highlight and is followed by non-token text, this non-token text will not be highlighted.

For example, consider the phrase ""this is a text with searchterm in it"". ""In"" and ""it"" are not tokenized because they're stopwords. Setting maxDocCharsToAnalyze to 36 (the length of the sentence) and searching for ""searchterm"" gives a fragment ending in ""searchterm"". The expected behaviour is to have ""in it"" at the end of the fragment, since maxDocCharsToAnalyse explicitely states that the whole phrase should be considered."

1,"HostConfiguration socketFactory is ignoredHostConfiguration doesn't use its host.protocol to execute an HttpMethod with an absolute URL.  It should, if the Protocol's scheme is the same as the method's URL scheme.

This bug makes it difficult to integrate a specialized SSL connection algorithm (in a SecureProtocolSocketFactory) with a module implemented on top of HttpClient.  The latter module must not execute methods with absolute URLs.  Of course, this is difficult when one doesn't control that module.  For example, I recently tried to integrate SSL certificate-based client authentication with XFire.  XFire provides a reasonable API for replacing its HttpClient, but one must hack its source code to prevent it from executing methods with absolute URLs.

Protocol.registerProtocol is a possible answer, but it can't support two or more SSL connection algorithms for one HTTPS host and port."

I tried to fix this issue but there is no way to access the BindVariables from the ConstraintBuilder from the LuceneQueryFactoryImpl and the ConstraintBuilder just passes the FullTextSearchImpl QOM subtree to the factory (via FullTextConstraint constructor) without any further visiting. If the signature would be ""LuceneQueryFactoryImpl#create(FullTextSearchImpl fts, Value searchExpression)"" we could visit the StaticOperand in the ConstraintBuilder and then modify the FullTextSearchImpl constructor accordingly, but this would imply that LuceneQueryFactory interface would need to be change accordingly and I don't know what that would mean."

1,"checkIfNodeLocked()  in jcr mapping layer  does not behave properly when open scoped locks are usedI am planning to use open-scoped lock.  For which , I need to persist the locktoken along with the node  so that it can be used by another session for unlocking.Tested with Jackrabbit RMI client and it works fine.

But I am using jcr-mapping layer to achieve the above in my project.Here I want that  as soon as a node is checked out, it gets locked by the session and the lock is stored in ""lockToken"" property of node ""Document"". For that I need to update the Document node after locking .

*public void checkout(String path)throws CMSException {
       pm = getPersistenceManager();

        }
   }*


Here doc.update() fails with Locked Exception.  The problem here is PersistenceManagerImpl has a method checkIfNodeLocked(path)  which returns LockException if node is locked. This method is checked before every update/insert. So, I am not able to update a locked node. I need to persist the locktoken in the node . What is the reason of checking  for a lock before saving ? Ideally , it should throw error only if node is locked and session does not hold the lockToken .

If the session who has locked the node tries to save the node without unlocking, it should be allowed .

p.s.
I am able to achieve the above by simple Jackrabbit RMI client.

1,"Impossible to import a string containing _x0020_  with Session.importXmlThe importXml uses the ValueHelper.serialize methods.

See: BufferedStringValue and StringValue getValue methods.

The result is that it is now impossible to import a string with _x0020_ in it, because it gets translated in a space. The simple solution would be to just turn off the declodeBlanks option, but I'm not sure why it was added in the first place. Another option would be to use real encoding instead of a replace like the o.a.j.util.ISO9075.

createWeight() method of its scorer instead of in the rewrite method of the
query itself.  Thus it bypasses the boolean typecheck when BooleanQuery is
deciding whether to use ConjunctionScorer or BooleanScorer, eventually resulting
in the UOE."

1,"Catch SocketTimeoutException not InterruptedIOExceptionThere are a couple of places where you're catching InterruptedIOException 
that should catch SocketTimeoutException instead.  For example, from 
HttpConnection:

    protected boolean isStale() {
        boolean isStale = true;
        if (isOpen) {
            // the connection is open, but now we have to see if we can 
read it
            // assume the connection is not stale.
            isStale = false;
            try {
                if (inputStream.available() == 0) {
                    try {
                        socket.setSoTimeout(1);
                        inputStream.mark(1);
                        int byteRead = inputStream.read();
                        if (byteRead == -1) {
                            // again - if the socket is reporting all data 
read,
                            // probably stale
                            isStale = true;
                        } else {
                            inputStream.reset();
                        }
                    } finally {
                        socket.setSoTimeout(this.params.getSoTimeout());
                    }
                }
            } catch (InterruptedIOException e) {
                // aha - the connection is NOT stale - continue on!

Here the catch of InterruptedIOException is intended to happen when 
inputStream.read() terminates due to the socket.setSoTimeout() time being 
reached.  However, it could also occur because Thread.interrupt() has been 
called, in which case ""continue on"" is not what should happen, instead, the 
request should terminate.

There are legitimate reasons why someone might want to interrupt the 
httpclient code, for example, httpclient does not provide a hard timeout on 
the total length of time a request may take, including connecting, sending 
the request, and receiving the complete response, so to enforce a hard 
timeout it is necessary to run the request in a worker thread and interrupt 
it if it hasn't completed before the timeout expires (the technique used in 
your TimeoutController class).

Note that SocketTimeoutException was added in 1.4.  For compatibility with 
older jdk versions, the code can catch InterruptedIOException and use 
getClass() to see whether it is a SocketTimeoutException.

There are probably other places in the code where InterruptedIOException is 
caught and interpreted as a socket timeout, and where Thread.interrupt() 
will not have the proper effect of causing the request to terminate ASAP, 
but I'm not familiar enough with the code to find them all."
1,"Adding empty ParallelReader indexes to an IndexWriter may cause ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException or NoSuchElementExceptionHi,
I recently stumbled upon this:

It is possible (and perfectly legal) to add empty indexes (IndexReaders) to an IndexWriter. However, when using ParallelReaders in this context, in two situations RuntimeExceptions may occur for no good reason.

Condition 1:
The indexes within the ParallelReader are just empty.

When adding them to the IndexWriter, we get a java.util.NoSuchElementException triggered by ParallelTermEnum's constructor. The reason for that is the TreeMap#firstKey() method which was assumed to return null if there is no entry (which is not true, apparently -- it only returns null if the first key in the Map is null).


Condition 2 (Assuming the aforementioned bug is fixed):
The indexes within the ParallelReader originally contained one or more fields with TermVectors, but all documents have been marked as deleted.

When adding the indexes to the IndexWriter, we get a java.lang.ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException triggered by TermVectorsWriter#addAllDocVectors. The reason here is that TermVectorsWriter assumes that if the index is marked to have TermVectors, at least one field actually exists for that. This unfortunately is not true, either.

Patches and a testcase demonstrating the two bugs are provided.

Cheers,
Christian"

      PostMethod post = new PostMethod(destinationUrl.toString());
      post.setStrictMode(false);
      post.setRequestHeader(""Content-Type"",""text/xml; charset=UTF-8"");

1,"[PATCH] TermInfosReader, SegmentTermEnum Out Of Memory ExceptionWe've been experiencing terrible memory problems on our production search server, running lucene (1.4.3).

Our live app regularly opens new indexes and, in doing so, releases old IndexReaders for garbage collection.

But...there appears to be a memory leak in org.apache.lucene.index.TermInfosReader.java.
Under certain conditions (possibly related to JVM version, although I've personally observed it under both linux JVM 1.4.2_06, and 1.5.0_03, and SUNOS JVM 1.4.1) the ThreadLocal member variable, ""enumerators"" doesn't get garbage-collected when the TermInfosReader object is gc-ed.

Looking at the code in TermInfosReader.java, there's no reason why it _shouldn't_ be gc-ed, so I can only presume (and I've seen this suggested elsewhere) that there could be a bug in the garbage collector of some JVMs.

I've seen this problem briefly discussed; in particular at the following URL:
  http://java2.5341.com/msg/85821.html
The patch that Doug recommended, which is included in lucene-1.4.3 doesn't work in our particular circumstances. Doug's patch only clears the ThreadLocal variable for the thread running the finalizer (my knowledge of java breaks down here - I'm not sure which thread actually runs the finalizer). In our situation, the TermInfosReader is (potentially) used by more than one thread, meaning that Doug's patch _doesn't_ allow the affected JVMs to correctly collect garbage.

So...I've devised a simple patch which, from my observations on linux JVMs 1.4.2_06, and 1.5.0_03, fixes this problem.

1,"MultiFieldQueryParser ignores slop parameterMultiFieldQueryParser.getFieldQuery(String, String, int) calls super.getFieldQuery(String, String), thus obliterating any slop parameter present in the query.

It should probably be changed to call super.getFieldQuery(String, String, int), except doing only that will result in a recursive loop which is a side-effect of what may be a deeper problem in MultiFieldQueryParser -- getFieldQuery(String, String, int) is documented as delegating to getFieldQuery(String, String), yet what it actually does is the exact opposite.  This also causes problems for subclasses which need to override getFieldQuery(String, String) to provide different behaviour.

1,"Event filtering by path not working as specifiedWhen filtering node events by path, the event filter doesn't compare using the ""associated parent path"", see JSR-170, 8.3.3:

""The set of events can be filtered by specifying restrictions based on characteristics of the associated parent node of the event. The associated parent node of an event is the parent node of the item at (or formerly at) the path returned by Event.getPath. The following restrictions are available:

• absPath, isDeep: Only events whose associated parent node is at absPath (or within its subtree, if isDeep is true) will be received. It is permissible to register a listener for a path where no node currently exists.""

(for property events, filtering is correct)

To fix this, the special handling of node events in EventFilter.blocks() simply needs to be removed.

According to HTTP 1.1 Spec : http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html#sec10.3.3
""The temporary URI SHOULD be given by the Location field in the response. Unless the request method was HEAD, the entity of the response SHOULD contain a short hypertext note with a hyperlink to the new URI(s).""

Now, in ""DefaultRedirectStrategy.getLocationURI()"", there's a ProtocolException thrown if location header is null.

    throw new ProtocolException(
        ""Received redirect response "" + response.getStatusLine()

1,"DavMethodBase#getResponseException fails if the body is not (valid) XMLI have a set up that uses the JCR Webdav Server from a custom remote client.
I've noticed one thing, anytime I request a node that doesn't exist the error that comes back from the server is as follows:

[Fatal Error] :1:941: The element type ""HR"" must be terminated by the matching end-tag ""</HR>"".
javax.jcr.RepositoryException: The element type ""HR"" must be terminated by the matching end-tag ""</HR>"".: The element type ""HR"" must be terminated by the matching end-tag ""</HR>"".

Doesn't really make sense, but that is OK, I can handle that.

My problem:
I have a partially populated repository that at the root has a few nodes like
/edu/....
/com/ibm/..

So, I want to create a few nodes of type nt:folder under

com/myCompany/folder1

I have no problem creating them, but since ""com"" already exists I end up with
com[2]/myCompany/folder1.

So, I went ahead and used the parentNode.hasNode(""folderName"") method.

This method returns true for the ""com"" portion, but when I test for the ""myCompany"" folder which should return false I get the error response shown above from the server.

The webdav request looks as follows:
PROPFIND /jackrabbit/server/default/jcr%3aroot/com/myCompany

The snippet of code looks as follows:
  private Node createFolders (Session session, Node parentNode, List <String> folders)
	  throws RepositoryException {
    Node folderNode = null;
    for (String folder : folders) {
	if (parentNode.hasNode(folder))
	    folderNode = parentNode.getNode(folder);

	parentNode = folderNode;
    }

1,"Versioning fixup leaves persistence in a state where the node can't be made versionable againJackrabbit's version recovery mode (org.apache.jackrabbit.version.recovery system property) disconnects all version histories that expose problems that manifest in unexpected exceptions being thrown. ""disconnects"" means removing the properties defined for mix:versionable and removing the mixin type. The actual versioning related nodes remain in place.

The problem: when re-adding mix:versionable, ItemSaveOperation.initVersionHistories tries to create the new version history in the same location (the path being derived from the versionable node's identifier), and consequently fails because of the broken underlying storage.

Session session3_2 = repo3.login(...); // Will fail with javax.jcr.RepositoryException: Directory was previously created with a different LockFactory instance

Open the first session in repo2 will fails but will also remove the .lock file, thus the second
session will succeed and may corrupt the repository because there are multiple session
opened from multiple repository.
The same behaviour occurs for repo3, the .lock file is removed but it is a slightly different case
as a new exception will be thrown while creating the Lucene index.

This is a clearly a twisted case as repositories pointing to the same home must not be created
simultaneously but i think that it must be more robust to prevent data corruption.

I reproduce the bug on JR 1.4.7 and 1.5.3 but i think it affects at least all versions of JR < 1.5.3."

1,"Request with two forward slashes for path failsThe following code demonstrates the problem:
        DefaultHttpClient client = new DefaultHttpClient();
        client.execute(new HttpGet(""http://www.google.com//""));

When a request is made, the DefaultRequestDirector invokes rewriteRequestURI(). I don't fully understand why this method does what it does. For a non-proxied request, it attempts to render the URI to a relative URI. In doing so, it tries to create a relative URI whose content is ""//"". Per RFC 2396 section 5 (Relative URI References), a relative URI that begins with ""//"" is a network-path reference, and the ""//"" must be immediately followed by an authority. Therefore, while ""http://www.google.com//"" is a valid absolute URI, ""//"" is not a valid relative one. The resulting exception:

1,"Sloppy Phrase Scorer matches the doc ""A B C D E"" for query = ""B C B""~2This is an extension of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/LUCENE-697

In addition to abnormalities Yonik pointed out in 697, there seem to be other issues with slopy phrase search and scoring.

1) A phrase with a repeated word would be detected in a document although it is not there.
I.e. document = A B D C E , query = ""B C B"" would not find this document (as expected), but query ""B C B""~2 would find it. 
I think that no matter how large the slop is, this document should not be a match.

2) A document containing both orders of a query, symmetrically, would score differently for the queru and for its reveresed form.
I.e. document = A B C B A would score differently for queries ""B C""~2 and ""C B""~2, although it is symmetric to both.

I will attach test cases that show both these problems and the one reported by Yonik in 697. "

1,"Explicit VirtualHosts Can Cause Issues On RedirectsIf you set an explicit virtual host then a getmethod may get stuck in a redirect
loop (up to maxRedirects).

e.g. execute a get on www.google.com (with a www.google.com virtualhost).  That
redirects to www.google.co.nz (at least if you come from an NZ IP).  The current
httpclient behavior is to then connect to www.google.co.nz but pass through,
with the request, ""Host: www.google.com"".  Google will then reply with another
www.google.co.nz redirect and the loop continues.

There are probably a few ways to work around this.  It seems reasonable to drop
an explicity set virtual host in the event a redirect redirects to a different
uri authority.  The following patch works for me:

This is by itself a bug, especially since missing search configuration is perfectly ok resulting in Jackrabbit not building the search index (which is - believe it or - what really want).

On that matter, since the configuration file structure seems to be implied by the configuration framework but the DTD is inlined into the configuration file, the configuration framework should act very gracefully to missing or wrong or unexpected configuration elements. Thus, for example, if the file system configuration (WorkspaceConfig.fsc) would be missing, the WorkspaceConfig should probably hint at this point and not throw a NullPointerException without further explanations (of course throwing anything at all is still better than going wild)."

2. create another hierarchy at different level - /site2
3. copy /site/en under /site2

1,"thread starving in MultiThreadedHttpConnectionManagerHi folks,

I might have found a bug in MTHCM. It has to do with removing HostConnectionPool instances that have no more connections in them. That was a fix for a memory leak we previously had. There are two cases where the pools get deleted. One is in handleLostConnection: (excerpt)
  ...
  if (hostPool.numConnections == 0) mapHosts.remove(config);
  notifyWaitingThread(config);
  ...

Could this delete a pool in which there is still a thread waiting to get a connection? If so, the thread would remain in the global pool. But even if it is interrupted there, it would still use the old HostConnectionPool in which no connection will ever become available again.

I suggest to change the removal check in both cases to:
  if ((hostPool.numConnections < 1) && hostPool.waitingThreads.isEmpty)

What do you think?"

corresponding to C?s version history and the removeExisting flag of the
restore is set to true, then that instance of C becomes the child of the
restored N. If the workspace currently has an already existing node

1,"SegmentInfo should explicitly track whether that segment wrote term vectorsToday SegmentInfo doesn't know if it has vectors, which means its files() method must check if the files exist.

This leads to subtle bugs, because Si.files() caches the files but then we fail to invalidate that later when the term vectors files are created.

It also leads to sloppy code, eg TermVectorsReader ""gracefully"" handles being opened when the files do not exist.  I don't like that; it should only be opened if they exist.

This also fixes these intermittent failures we've been seeing:

1,"SharedItemStateManager not properly synchronizedSome time ago we removed synchronized modifiers from the methods store() hasItemState() and getItemState(). While some care has been taken to ensure the cache integrity, I think the contract for the SharedItemStateManager (SISM) is now broken. The JavaDoc does not clearly document this, but I think all relevant methods of the SISM working on ItemStates should be atomic.

E.g. a call to hasItemState() should not return true for an ItemState that another thread is currently adding in store(). Similarly a getItemState() should not return an ItemState that is currenly added or modified in a store() operation.

Currently I see two options:
- Change the methods to synchronized again. This will actually serialize all calls to the SISM.
- Implement a more sophisticated synchronisation. E.g. multiple store operations can still be allowed, as long as their ChangeLogs do not intersect. Retrieving ItemStates might still be allowed while a ChangeLog is stored, as long as the ItemState to retrieve is not part of the ChangeLog.

Comments and suggestions are very welcome."
1,"Inconsistency when version with a label is removedWhile executing random operations on the version storage I came across a situation where a version is removed that has a version label.

The current behaviour in jackrabbit is IMO not correct because the version node gets removed, but the version label is still present in the version history. This means there is a referenceable property that points to nowhere.

So I guess either:

- the version label property must be removed as well when the version is removed
or
- the remove version operation should fail because the version is still referenced

I wasn't able to find a relevant section in the spec, though I must admit that I don't know the versioning section that well."
1,"AbstractClientConnAdapter doesn't ensure that only one of ConnectionReleaseTrigger.abortConnection, .releaseConnection has effectIf HttpUriRequest.abort() is called at about the same time that the request completes, it's possible for an aborted connection to be returned to the pool.  The next time the connection is used, HttpClient.execute fails without retrying, throwing this exception:

java.io.IOException: Connection already shutdown
	at org.apache.http.impl.conn.DefaultClientConnection.opening(DefaultClientConnection.java:112)

	at org.apache.http.impl.client.AbstractHttpClient.execute(AbstractHttpClient.java:576)

Steps to reproduce:
1) Set a breakpoint in ThreadSafeClientConnManager.releaseConnection just after ""reusable"" is set (and found to be true).
2) Run to the breakpoint in releaseConnection.
3) Call HttpUriRequest.abort.
4) Let releaseConnection complete.

When the connection is next used, the exception will be thrown.

Snippet from ThreadSafeClientConnManager:
    public void releaseConnection(ManagedClientConnection conn, long validDuration, TimeUnit timeUnit) {
		...
            boolean reusable = hca.isMarkedReusable();
            if (log.isDebugEnabled()) {                             // breakpoint here
                if (reusable) {
                    log.debug(""Released connection is reusable."");

                connectionPool.freeEntry(entry, reusable, validDuration, timeUnit);
            }
        }
    }


I think that AbstractClientConnAdapter should be modified as follows:

1) Add ""released"" flag:

    /** True if the connection has been released. */
    private boolean released;

2) Modify abortConnection:

    public void abortConnection() {
        synchronized(this) {
            if (aborted || released) {
                return;
            }
            aborted = true;
        }
        unmarkReusable(); // this line and all that follow unchanged

3) Modify releaseConnection:

    public void releaseConnection() {
        synchronized(this) {
            if (aborted || released) {
                return;
            }
            released = true;
        }
        if (connManager != null) {
            connManager.releaseConnection(this, duration, TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS);
        }

1,"UserAccessControlProvider handles users who dont have Jackrabbit managed Principals or User node inconsistently.JR core 2.0.0
In UserAccessControlProvider.compilePermissions(...), if no principal relating to a user node can be found, then a set or read only compiled permissions is provided. That set gives the session read only access to the entire security workspace regardless of path.

If the user node is found, then an instance of UserAccessControlProvider.CompilePermissions is used and in UserAccessControlProvider.CompilePermissions.buildResult(...) there is a check for no user node. If there is no user node, all permissions are denied regardless of path.

Although the first case will never happen for an installation of Jackrabbit where there are no custom PrincipalManagers, I suspect, based on the impl of UserAccessControlProvider.CompilePermissions.buildResult(...) was to deny all access to the security workspace where there was no corresponding user node in a set of principals.

Since this does not effect JR unless there is an external Principal Manager its a bit hard to produce a compact unit test, the issue was found by looking at the code."

1,"Protocol interceptors not called when executing CONNECT methodsWhen the DefaultRequestDirector tries to establish a route via a proxy to a https target, registered protocol interceptors aren't being called in the createTunnelToTarget method. "
1,"The PostMethod did not bring back response headers from proxy serversDescription:

When doing tunnelling through proxy servers, in case of 407 response, the 
wrapper class ConnectMethod failed to pass the response header back to the 
wrapped method (PostMethod in our case).  As result, the response headers are 
not passed back to the application.

Proposed Fix:
Change the ConnectMethod to use the wrapped method instance to get response 
headers.  It will be reinitialized again if ""CONNECT"" is successful.

Also have to modify the addProxyAuthorizationRequestHeader code to use the 
wrapped method for the authenticator to work."
1,"URI Absolutization does not follow browser behaviorThis was encountered using Heritrix to crawl a prominent website.

The URI resulting from the HttpClient URI constructor (base, relative) does not follow browser behavior:
URI newUrl = new URI(new URI(""http://www.theirwebsite.com/browse/results?type=browse&att=1""), ""?sort=0&offset=11&pageSize=10"")

Results in newUrl:
http://www.theirwebsite.com/browse/?sort=0&offset=11&pageSize=10

The desired behavior based on Firefox and IE should be:
http://www.theirwebsite.com/browse/results?sort=0&offset=11&pageSize=10

These browsers treat the question mark similar to a directory separator and do not require a file to be specified before the query.

HttpClient's current behavior does not correspond to current browser behavior and leads to an inability to crawl certain websites if HttpClient's URI class is used.

1,"Inconsistent behaviour sorting against field with no related documentsIn StringSortedHitQueue - generateSortIndex seems to mistake 
the TermEnum having values as indicating that the sort field 
has entries in the index.

In the case where the search has matching results an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds
exception is thrown in sortValue (line 177 StringSortedHitQueue)
as generateSortIndex creates a terms array of zero length and fieldOrder
contains 0 for all documents.

It would seem more helpful if:
a) generateSortIndex catches the lack of any documents with the sort field.

or

b) reserve terms[0] as a special value for documents that do not have
matching sort field values. ie Change the current implementation to add 1
to the index and change terms[0] to ensure it sorts ""untagged"" documents to
first or last.

For my application Id much prefer solution (b) as it allows much smaller 
indexes and make searching using sort values less brittle.

Thats the best my communication skills can muster just now. Could change
current code to something like:

private final int[] generateSortIndex()
throws IOException {

	final int[] retArray = new int[reader.maxDoc()];
	final String[] mterms = new String[reader.maxDoc() + 1];  // guess length
	if (retArray.length > 0) {
		TermDocs termDocs = reader.termDocs();
		// change this value to control if documents without sort field come first or last
		mterms[0] = """";  // XXXXXXXXX change
		int t = 1;  // current term number  XXXXXXXXXXXXX change
		try {
	

			do {
				Term term = enumerator.term();
				if (term.field() != field) break;

				// store term text
				// we expect that there is at most one term per document
				if (t >= mterms.length) throw new RuntimeException (""there are more terms
than documents in field \""""+field+""\"""");
				mterms[t] = term.text();

				// store which documents use this term
				termDocs.seek (enumerator);
				while (termDocs.next()) {
					retArray[termDocs.doc()] = t;
				}

				t++;
			} while (enumerator.next());
		} finally {
			termDocs.close();
		}

		// if there are less terms than documents,
		// trim off the dead array space
		if (t < mterms.length) {
			terms = new String[t];
			System.arraycopy (mterms, 0, terms, 0, t);
		} else {
			terms = mterms;
		}
	}
	return retArray;
}

Having very quick look at IntegerSortedHitQueue would seem possible
to do same thing. Maybe creating Integer wrapper objects once.

Hope that made some sort of sense. Im not very familiar with the code
or Lucene terminology.
If the above seems like a useful approach Id be glad to generate patches
for a cleaned up version.

Thanks

1,"MultiReader should make a private copy of the subReaders arraySpinoff from here:

Because MultiReader just holds a reference to the array that was passed in, it's possible to hit scary exceptions (that look like index corruption) if that array is later altered eg by reopening some of the readers.

The fix is trivial: just make a private copy."

1,"Cloning a tree containing shareable nodes into another workspace throws ItemExistsExceptionThere's a problem when trying to clone a tree in another workspace, when this tree contains shareable nodes.

Let ws1 be one workspace, which contains one node A. This node has two sub-nodes B and C. B and C share a shareable sub-node D :

A 
|   \
B  C
|    |
D  D

Let ws2 be a second workspace. Then calling ws2.clone(""ws1"" , ""/A"" , ""/A"" , false) throws an ItemExistsException ( copyNodeState line 1628 ) . This is done when the copyNodeState is checking if the nodeId is already present in the workspace - which is the case when copying the second instance of the shareable node. I can't find in the specification something about this case - but it would be logical to add a share to the node when coming across this situation - at least in the CLONE ( and probable COPY too ) cases. I don't know what would be expected in the CLONE_REMOVE_EXISTING case - we might not want to remove the node if it's shareable, and also add a share here.

I fixed the issue by handling the case the node is shareable in the COPY and CLONE cases of copyNodeState - you'll find attached the corresponding patch. Do you think this solution is ok ?"

1,"NodeTypeRegistry.reregister unregisters dependent typesNodeTypeRegistry.reregister allows modifying a registered node type if the difference to the currently registered node type with the same name is TRIVIAL according to NodeTypeDefDiff.

Before registering the new node type definition the old node type is unregistered. The side effect of that first step is that also all NodeTypes, which depend (extend ?) the node type to be re-registered, are removed from the registry.

After the modified node type is then registered, the previously registered dependent node types will not be registered anymore and will not be known any more.

While it makes sense to me, to temporarily unregister dependent node types, those must be registered again after the re-registered node type has been registered. Otherwise the system may become pretty useless."

1,"HttpClient does not retry authentication when multiple challenges are present if the primary one failsI'm trying to request a page from IIS (6 and 7.5).  If the IIS is configured with providers for ""negotiate"" and ""ntlm"" then the Negotiate authentication is tried and fails, but it does not then try to use the NTLM authentication which is what I require.  If I removed ""negotiate"" as a provider from IIS and just use NTLM then all works well - but this is not a solution as I don't have control of the web servers.

one of the new cookies is reported to be added as:

i.e. the same as without using a proxy. 7295 is the port number used to access the proxy. The target domain www.seoconsultants.com is accessed through the regular HTTP port number 80, thus the cookie matching should also refer to port 80 and not the proxy's port."
1,"SegmentReader.doCommit should be sync'd; norms methods need not be sync'dI fixed the failure in TestNRTThreads, but in the process tripped an assert because SegmentReader.doCommit isn't sync'd.

So I sync'd it, but I don't think the norms APIs need to be sync'd -- we populate norms up front and then never change them.  Un-sync'ing them is important so that in the NRT case calling IW.commit doesn't block searches trying to pull norms.

Also some small code refactoring."

1,"IndexReader.isCurrent incorrectly returns false after writer.prepareCommit has been calledSpinoff from thread ""2 phase commit with external data"" on java-user.

The IndexReader should not see the index as changed, after a prepareCommit has been called but before commit is called."
1,"Missing Content-Length header causes a SocketExceptionEssentially, we have an invalid HTTP server (Stellent CMS actually and we will file a bug with them), 
which is returning headers like:

HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic ""Secure Realm""
Connection: keep-alive

Which is clearly missing the Content-Length header.  Now, previously HttpClient handled this 
perfectly by reading until the end of the connection (ie: treating it like it was a Connection: close), 
however for some reason a socket exception is being thrown and the invalid connection is added 
back into the connection pool and then every connection to the server after that thows an 
exception.

See the thread ""SocketException with invalid server"" for the full discussion of the issue.

I'll attach a patch that fixes the problem.  The biggest thing to consider is the changes to the 
duplicate Connection header test cases which resolves around the question: if Connection: keep-
alive is present but no Content-Length is provided, should the connection be closed?  The patch 
requires the answer to be yes and I really can't see any other way to do it."

This seems to be caused by a known JVM bug:
http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4949631

Strings over 16Mb can cause the problem.   Some workarounds are listed, the
essence being to split the string and call getBytes on each piece and reassemble
with a ByteBuffer."

1,"errors in text filters can cause indexing to fail without warning the clienti've opened this issue to track the discussion at <http://thread.gmane.org/gmane.comp.apache.jackrabbit.devel/5086>. briefly, exceptions thrown by text filters are logged and swallowed by jackrabbit; there's no way for a text filter to signal to the jcr client that indexing failed.

some solutions have been proposed, including throwing an unchecked exception, which doesn't allow jackrabbit to maintain transactional integrity, and giving filters veto power over the observed repository operation. depending on the difficulty of the solution that is eventually determined to be correct, it may be sufficient for 1.0 to document the issue and perhaps improve the warning/error logging.

1,NPE in event polling threadThis exception occurs when running the jcr2dav integration tests. This surfaces as a  side effect of JCR-3046. The root cause is refresh(Event) not guarding against null values returned from Event.getItemId().
1,"ConstantScoreRangeQuery - fixes ""too many clauses"" exceptionConstantScoreQuery wraps a filter (representing a set of documents) and returns
a constant score for each document in the set.

ConstantScoreRangeQuery implements a RangeQuery that works for any number of
terms in the range.  It rewrites to a ConstantScoreQuery that wraps a RangeFilter.

Still needed:
  - unit tests (these classes have been tested and work fine in-house, but the
current tests rely on too much application specific code)
  - code review of Weight() implementation (I'm unsure If I got all the score
normalization stuff right)
  - explain() implementation

1,"DistanceFilter problem with deleted documentsI know this is the locallucene lib, but wanted to make sure we don't get this bug when it gets into lucene contrib.

I suspect that the issue is that deleted documents are trying to be evaluated by the filter.  I did some debugging and I confirmed that it is bombing on a document that is marked as deleted (using Luke).


Thanks!

Furthermore the same bug can exist in removing-filters if they have enablePositionIncrements=false.
I think this option is useful: but it shouldnt mean 'allow broken tokenstream', it just means we
don't add gaps. 

If you remove tokens with enablePositionIncrements=false it should not cause the TS to start with
positionincrement=0, and it shouldnt 'restructure' the tokenstream (e.g. moving synonyms on top of a different word).
It should just not add any 'holes'.
"
1,"DocumentWriter closes TokenStreams too earlyThe DocumentWriter closes a TokenStream as soon as it has consumed its tokens. The javadoc of TokenStream.close() says that it releases resources associated with the stream. However, the DocumentWriter keeps references of the resources (i. e. payload byte arrays, term strings) until it writes the postings to the new segment, which means that DocumentWriter should call TokenStream.close() after it has written the postings.

This problem occurs in multithreaded applications where e. g. pooling is used for the resources. My patch adds a new test to TestPayloads which shows this problem. Multiple threads add documents with payloads to an index and use a pool of byte arrays for the payloads. TokenStream.close() puts the byte arrays back into the pool. The test fails with the old version but runs successfully with the patched version. 

All other units tests pass as well.

* create an index with arbitrary content, and close it
* open IndexWriter again, and add a document with binary field (stored but not compressed)
* close IndexWriter _without_ optimizing, so that the new document is in a separate segment.
* open IndexReader. You can read the last document and its binary field just fine.
* open IndexWriter, optimize the index, close IndexWriter
* open IndexReader. Now the field is still present (not null) and is marked as binary, but the data is not there - Field.getBinaryLength() returns 0.

1,"fix reverseStringFilter for unicode 4.0ReverseStringFilter is not aware of supplementary characters: when it reverses it will create unpaired surrogates, which will be replaced by U+FFFD by the indexer (but not at query time).

Also need to check the wordnet parser in the memory contrib for this problem.

If this is a false alarm, i'm not worried, because the test will be the first unit test wordnet package ever had.

word ""king"", we get:

baron
magnate

power
queen

Here, ""scrofula"" and ""struma"" are extraneous. This happens because, the line

in entry s(114144247,3,'king''s evil',n,1,1) in  wn_s.pl file, as

We have resolved this by adding a statement in the line parsing portion of

           // parse line
           line = line.substring(2);
          * line = line.replaceAll(""\'\'"", ""`""); // added statement*
           int comma = line.indexOf(',');
           String num = line.substring(0, comma);  ... ... etc.
In short we replace ""''"" by ""`"" (a back-quote). Then on recreating the
index, we get:

On deserialisation the resulting PropertyState's InternalValue's size is only half as the origianl (e.g. 150Kbyte)

1,"Importing strings with special characters failsBoth Session.importXML and Workspace.importXML don't work correctly in some cases.

Importing very large foreign language (for example, Chinese) text property values could result in incorrect values on some platforms. The reason is, BufferedStringValue (buffers very large string to a temporary file) uses the platform default encoding to read and write the text.

BufferedStringValue is relatively slow on some systems when importing large texts or binary data because of using FD().sync().

If an exported string value contains a carriage return (\r), this character was truncated on some platforms.

If an exported string value contains a characters with code below 32 excluding newline (\n) and tab (\t) - for example form feed (\f) - the imported string value was base64 encoded.

When IndexFileDeleter lists the directory, looking for segments_X
files to load, if it hits a FNFE on opening such a file it should
catch this and treat it as if the file does not exist.

On NFS (and possibly other file systems), a directory listing is not
guaranteed to be ""current""/coherent.  Specifically, if machine #1 has
just removed file ""segments_n"" and shortly thereafer machine #2 does a
dir listing, it's possible (likely?) that the dir listing will still
show that segments_n exists.

I think the fix is simple: catch the FNFE and just handle it as if the
segments_n does not in fact exist.

1,"Cluster information is not persisted to database when connected to case sensitive MS SQL Server 2005After a call to Session::save, we observed that cluster information was not written to the ${schemaObjectPrefix}JOURNAL and ${schemaObjectPrefix}GLOBAL_REVISION tables. We tested against Oracle 10 database servers and MS Sql Server 2005 servers. The problem was noticed only with MS Sql Server 2005. 

Initially, the problem was masked since the test was written as part of our unit test environment and the exceptions generated by JDBC were not showing up in the logs. A separate test with was carried out as shown by the code below

<pre>
import java.io.FileInputStream;

import javax.jcr.Node;
import javax.jcr.Repository;
import javax.jcr.Session;
import javax.jcr.SimpleCredentials;

import org.apache.jackrabbit.core.TransientRepository;

        root.addNode(""node3"");
        
        session.save();
    }
}
</pre>

The configuration file used to configure the repository is attached.

After debugging this, we obtained the exceptions that were previously not visible. Note that, JackRabbit continues to run (is that because the cluster code is running in a separate thread?) even after this exception. The problem was that the 'revision_id' field did not exist. The mssql.ddl schema file sets up the table names in capitals. However, at least two of the SQL statements in DatabaseJournal use lower case table names. For example:-

<pre>
        updateGlobalStmt = con.prepareStatement(
                ""update "" + schemaObjectPrefix + ""global_revision "" +
                ""set revision_id = revision_id + 1"");
        selectGlobalStmt = con.prepareStatement(
                ""select revision_id "" +
                ""from "" + schemaObjectPrefix + ""global_revision"");
</pre>

An additional error is that the mssql.ddl file is missing the following:

<pre>
# Inserting the one and only revision counter record now helps avoiding race conditions
insert into ${schemaObjectPrefix}GLOBAL_REVISION VALUES(0)
</pre>

Fixing the above two issues, fixed the problem with MS SQL Server 2005."

The addIndexesNoOptimize method first merges eligible segments
according to the MergePolicy, and then copies over one by one any
remaining ""external"" segments.

That copy can possibly (rather rarely) result in new merges becoming
eligible because its size can change if the index being added was
created with autoCommit=false.

However, we fail to then invoke the MergeScheduler to run these
merges.  As a result, in close, where we wait until all running and
pending merges complete, we will never return.

The fix is simple: invoke the merge scheduler inside
copyExternalSegments() if any segments were copied.  I also added
defensive invocation of the merge scheduler during close, just in case
other code paths could allow for a merge to be added to the pending
queue but not scheduled.

And the code successfully adds the indexes. This code uses chunks of 64MB, however that might be too large for some applications, so we definitely need a smaller one. The question is how small so that performance won't be affected, and it'd be great if we can let it be configurable, however since that API is called by other API, such as addIndexes, not sure it's easily controllable.

Also, I read somewhere (can't remember now where) that on Linux the native impl is better and does copy in chunks. So perhaps we should make a Linux specific impl?"
1,"Problems with BundleDbPersistenceManager getAllNodeIdsWhen using MySQL:
The problem arises when the method parameter maxcount is less than the total amount of records in the bundle table.

First of all I found out that mysql orders the nodeid objects different than jackrabbit does. The following test describes this idea:

    public void testMySQLOrderByNodeId() throws Exception {
        NodeId nodeId1 = new NodeId(""7ff9e87c-f87f-4d35-9d61-2e298e56ac37"");
        NodeId nodeId2 = new NodeId(""9fd0d452-b5d0-426b-8a0f-bef830ba0495"");

        PreparedStatement stmt = connection.prepareStatement(""SELECT NODE_ID FROM DEFAULT_BUNDLE WHERE NODE_ID = ? OR NODE_ID = ? ORDER BY NODE_ID"");

        Object[] params = new Object[] { nodeId1.getRawBytes(), nodeId2.getRawBytes() };
        stmt.setObject(1, params[0]);
        stmt.setObject(2, params[1]);

        ArrayList<NodeId> nodeIds = new ArrayList<NodeId>();
        ResultSet resultSet = stmt.executeQuery();
        while(resultSet.next()) {
            NodeId nodeId = new NodeId(resultSet.getBytes(1));
            System.out.println(nodeId);
            nodeIds.add(nodeId);
        }
        Collections.sort(nodeIds);
        for (NodeId nodeId : nodeIds) {
            System.out.println(nodeId);
        }
    }

Which results in the following output:

7ff9e87c-f87f-4d35-9d61-2e298e56ac37
9fd0d452-b5d0-426b-8a0f-bef830ba0495

7ff9e87c-f87f-4d35-9d61-2e298e56ac37


Now the problem with the getAllNodeIds method is that it fetches an extra 10 records on top of maxcount (to avoid a problem where the first key is not the one you that is wanted). Afterwards it skips a number of records again, this time using nodeid.compareto. This compareto statement returns true unexpectedly for mysql because the code doesn't expect the mysql ordering.

I had the situation where I had about 17000 records in the bundle table but consecutively getting the ids a thousand records at a time returned only about 8000 records in all.

1,"DisjunctionSumScorer gives slightly (float iotas) different scores when you .nextDoc vs .advanceSpinoff from LUCENE-1536.

I dug into why we hit a score diff when using luceneutil to benchmark
the patch.

At first I thought it was BS1/BS2 difference, but because of a bug in
the patch it was still using BS2 (but should be BS1) -- Robert's last
patch fixes that.

But it's actually a diff in BS2 itself, whether you next or advance
through the docs.

It's because DisjunctionSumScorer, when summing the float scores for a
given doc that matches multiple sub-scorers, might sum in a different
order, when you had .nextDoc'd to that doc than when you had .advance'd
to it.

This in turn is because the PQ used by that scorer (ScorerDocQueue)

1,"TermSpans skipTo() doesn't always move forwardsIn TermSpans (or the anonymous Spans class returned by SpansTermQuery, depending on the version), the skipTo() method is improperly implemented if the target doc is less than or equal to the current doc:

  public boolean skipTo(int target) throws IOException {
          // are we already at the correct position?
          if (doc >= target) {
            return true;
          }

          ...


This violates the correct behavior (as described in the Spans interface documentation), that skipTo() should always move forwards, in other words the correct implementation would be:

if (doc >= target) {
  return next();
}

This bug causes particular problems if one wants to use the payloads feature - this is because if one loads a payload, then performs a skipTo() to the same document, then tries to load the ""next"" payload, the spans hasn't changed position and it attempts to load the same payload again (which is an error)."

Subject: Re: does the MultiSearcher class calculate IDF properly?


a quick glance at the code seems to indicate that MultiSearcher has code 
for calcuating the docFreq accross all of the Searchables when searching 
(or when the docFreq method is explicitly called) but that explain method 
just delegates to Searchable that the specific docid came from.

if you compare that Explanation score you got with the score returned by 
a HitCollector (or TopDocs) they probably won't match.

So i would say ""yes MultiSearcher calculates IDF properly, but 
MultiSeracher.explain is broken.  Please file a bug about this, i can't 
think of an easy way to fix it, but it certianly seems broken to me.

1,"Deadlock in acl.EntryCollector / ItemManagerHere's another three-way deadlock that we've encountered:

* Thread A holds a downgraded SISM write lock and is about to start delivering observation events to synchronous listeners
* Thread B wants to write something and blocks waiting for the SISM write lock (since A holds the lock)
* Thread C wants to read something and blocks waiting for the SISM read lock (since B waits for the lock)

Normally such a scenario is handled without any problems, but there's a problem if the session used by thread C has a synchronous observation listener that attempts to read something from the repository during event delivery. In this case the following can happen:

* Thread C holds the ItemManager synchronization lock higher up in the call chain
* Observation listener code called by thread A attempts to read something from the repository, and blocks trying to acquire the ItemManager synchronization lock (since C holds it)

In principle such a scenario should never happen as an observation listener (much less a synchronous one) should never try to use the session that might already be in use by another thread.

Unfortunately the EntryCollector class in o.a.j.core.security.authorization.acl does not follow this guideline, which leads to the deadlock as shown below:

1,"Benchmark package uses new TopFieldCollector but also still uses AUTO without resolving it - result is, our sort algorithms won't runAUTO does not work with TopFieldCollector. If you want to use AUTO with TopFieldCollector, we have a convienence method called detectType on SortField, but it is package protected and so cannot be used here as a stop gap or by users if they wanted to mix AUTO with TopFieldCollector. Lucene does still handle this for back compat internally. Solr got bit here when it was switched to use TopFieldCollector - no auto resolution was added (detectType help couldn't have been used due to visibility), and the result was that plugin code that used to be able to use AUTO would now blow up. You shouldn't use AUTO in Solr anyway though.

The Benchmark package got bit as well  when it moved to TopFieldCollector. Sort algorithms allowed auto if you specified it, or if you left off the type. Now our sort algs fail because they didn't specify a type.

I'll change to require the type to be specified to get the algs working again. I was thinking of just putting auto resolution in as a stop gap till 3.0 (when auto is removed), but since detectFieldType is package protected and I don't want to repeat it, disallowing auto seems the best way to go."

having a closer look at it revealed that the problem is caused in the WorkspaceItemStateFactory where the property entry is retrieved from the

1,"Parsing built-in CND and XML nodetypes does not result in equal nt-definitionsi created a test in order to make sure builtin-nodetypes.xml and builtin-nodetypes.cnd provide the same definitions (actually i only wanted to test my own changes).

it reveals that the existing built-in NodeTypeDefinitions are not equal due to the following reason:

- in the xml-format nt:base is always specified if no other super type extends from nt:base
- in the cnd notation the nt:base is omitted (see below for quote from appendix of jsr 283) even if other super type(s) are
  defined and none of them extends from nt:base.

this affects the following nodetypes (all extending from mix:referenceable only):

nt:versionHistory
nt:version
nt:frozenNode
nt:resource


quote from public-review of jsr 283:

""7.2.2.4 Supertypes [...]
After the node type name comes the optional list of supertypes. If this element is not present and the node type is not a mixin (see 7.2.2.5 Options), then a supertype of nt:base is assumed.""


I'm not totally sure, if according to the quote above the built-in cnd-definitions are valid at all. since it states, that the nt:base is assumed if no other super type is defined. In the case of the node types above, mix:referenceable is defined to be the only super type, which is not totally true... the non-mixin types are always sub types of nt:base.

In either case: From my understanding the node types resulting from parsing the xml and the cnd file should be equal.
If the definitions are valid, we may need to adjust the CompactNodeTypeDefReader.

What happens here is that we flush all threads and then release the lock (letting other flushes which came in after we entered the flushAllThread context, continue) so that we could concurrently get a new segment that transports global deletes without the corresponding add.

1,"Removal of versions throws javax.jcr.ReferentialIntegrityExceptionFrom the following thread : http://www.mail-archive.com/jackrabbit-dev%40incubator.apache.org/msg03483.html

When trying to remove a version of a Node  the VersionHistory.removeVersion() method throws : ""javax.jcr.ReferentialIntegrityException: Unable to remove version. At least once referenced."".

Secton 8.2.2.10 (Removal of Versions) of the specification indicates that the version graph should be automatically repaired upon removal. Then, VersionHistory.removeVersion() should take care of references. (In fact, a user cannot alter the references (jcr:predecessors and jcr:successors), since they are protected properties.)

Here's the example (*updated) :

Node root1 = session.getRootNode() ;
Node test1 = root1.addNode(""test"") ;
test1.addMixin(""mix:versionable"");
test1.setProperty(""test"", ""1"");
session.save();
test1.checkin();

test1.checkout();
test1.setProperty(""test"", ""2"");
session.save();
test1.checkin();

test1.checkout();
test1.setProperty(""test"", ""3"");
session.save();
test1.checkin();

String baseVersion = test1.getBaseVersion().getName();
System.out.println(""Base version name: "" + baseVersion);

1,"addIndexes unexpectedly closes indexIt seems that in 1.4rc2, a call to IndexWriter.addIndexes (IndexReader[]) will

I added a testcase, javadoc and a slightly different implementation to it. I guess this is not breaking any back compat. as a call to those methodes would have caused an infinite loop anyway.

1,"IndexWriter memory leak when large docs are indexedSpinoff from the java-user thread ""IndexWriter and memory usage""...

IndexWriter has had a long standing memory leak, since LUCENE-843.

When the byte/char/int blocks are recycled to the common pool, the
per-thread DW classes incorrectly still hold a reference to them.

This normally is not a problem, since these buffers will be re-used
again.

But, if you index a massive document, causing IW to allocate more than
the RAM buffer allocated to it, then the leak happens.  So you could
have a 16 MB RAM buffer set, but if a huge doc required allocation of
200 MB worth of arrays, those 200 MB are never freed (well, until you
close the IW and deref it from the app).

It's even worse if you use multiple threads: if each thread has ever
had to index a massive document, then that thread incorrectly holds
onto the extra arrays.

While the Jackrabbit LocalFileSystem implementation silently ignores a request to delete a non-existing file, our internal implementation of the interface throws a FileSystemException in this case, which cause destroy to fail.

1,"ObjectConverterImpl.getObject(Session, Class, String) may not resolve mapping correctly for incompletely described mappingsWhen a node is mapped by calling the ObjectConverter.getObject(Session, Class, String) method and no discriminator property is configured the ObjectConverterImpl class tries to find a ""best"" mapping for the effective node. This is done by walking the class descriptor hierarchy starting at the descriptor for the selected class until a mapping for the node type is found.

In case the class descriptor hierarchy is incomplete because an improperly defined class descriptor would actually perfectly map the node but is not declared to extend (or implement) its parent classes/interfaces, the hierarchy walk down will not find the mapping and thus in the end, the originally requested class will be instantiated. If the class is abstract or an interface this of course fails.

If an exact class descriptor for the node type would be looked up directly, the mapping might be found immediately and the class of the descriptor can be verified it actually is assignement compatible with the requested class. If this would fail, we could still walk the hierarchy to see, whether we find another classdescriptor.

To clarify the issue consider the following example of an abstract base class and a concrete extension class with their node types

   AbstractBaseClass maps abstractly to AbstractBaseType
   BaseClass (extends AbstractBaseClass) maps to BaseType ( with supertype AbstractBaseType )

Note, that the BaseClass mapping does not declare to extend the AbstractBaseClass.

When calling ObjectConverterImpl.getObject(session, AbstractBaseClass.class, aBaseTypeNode), the descriptor fore the AbstractBaseClass is inspected agains the node and then it is decided to check the class descriptor hierarchy. Node mapping can be found by walking the hierarchy and hence the AbstractBaseClass is instantiated, which of course fails.

If the BaseClass mapping would be declared as extending the AbstractBaseClass mapping, everything would be fine."

1,"CircularRedirectException encountered when using a proxy, but not when reaching the target directlyA CircularRedirectException is encountered when using a proxy (tinyproxy on a remote machine), whereas everything is fine when using no proxy. The target is a URL such as http://www.seoconsultants.com/w3c/status-codes/301.asp which has a 301 redirection.

The issue can be fixed by using ALLOW_CIRCULAR_REDIRECTS set to true (client params), but I can't consider this a ""real"" fix.

Here is a snippet of code that exemplifies the problem (use your own proxy):

---
String proxyHost = ""xyz.webfactional.com"";
int proxyPort = 7295;

DefaultHttpClient httpclient = new DefaultHttpClient();
// without a proxy it's OK!
httpclient.getParams().setParameter(ConnRoutePNames.DEFAULT_PROXY,
        new HttpHost(proxyHost, proxyPort, ""http""));

HttpParams params = httpclient.getParams();
HttpClientParams.setRedirecting(params, true);
HttpProtocolParams.setUserAgent(params,
        ""Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.5; en-US; rv:1.9.0.10) Gecko/2009042315 Firefox/3.0.10"");

// OK, this fixes the problem, but at what cost / other problems ?
//httpclient.getParams().setParameter(ClientPNames.ALLOW_CIRCULAR_REDIRECTS, true);

String url = ""http://www.seoconsultants.com/w3c/status-codes/301.asp"";

HttpUriRequest request;
HttpResponse response;

request = new HttpGet(url);
System.out.println(""request = "" + request.getRequestLine());
response = httpclient.execute(request);
System.out.println(""status = "" + response.getStatusLine());
System.out.println(""headers = "" + Arrays.asList(response.getAllHeaders()));

1,"ConnectException not handled in DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandlerCopied from my mailing list post, Oleg suggested I post it to JIRA for 4.0 fix.

i am using commons-httpclient.3.0.1 and I am sending some requests
through https protocol. I have a problem with a long creation of
connection if ip address of remote service is not existing. I think
problem is in the situation when https connection is not created and
ConnectException is thrown after connection timeout. This exception is
catched in HttpMethodDirector.java in method executeWithRetry. Then
the DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler is called to recognize whether
connection creation will be repeated or not.
I think, that special handling for ConnectException is missing in
retryMethod of DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler, because exception is not
recognized and connetions are created again.
On the other hand, ConnectTimeoutException is thrown after connection
timeout for HTTP. This exception is handled in
DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler and call is stopped.

These lines of code handle ConnectTimeoutException in retryMethod of
DefaultHttpMethodRetryHandler:
if (exception instanceof InterruptedIOException) {
            // Timeout
            return false;
        }

Probably this is missing for ConnectException:
if (exception instanceof InterruptedIOException || exception
instanceof ConnectException) {
            // Timeout
            return false;
        }

1,"JNDIDatabaseJournal doesn't work with ""oracle"" schema (or: unable to use OracleDatabaseJournal with a jndi datasource)Database journal works fine on oracle when using the OracleDatabaseJournal implementation; but when you need to use a jndi datasource you actually need to use org.apache.jackrabbit.core.journal.JNDIDatabaseJournal which doesn't work fine with the ""oracle"" schema.

With the following configuration:
<Cluster id=""node1"" syncDelay=""10"">
    <Journal class=""org.apache.jackrabbit.core.journal.JNDIDatabaseJournal"">
      <param name=""schema"" value=""oracle"" />

jackrabbit crashes at startup with a not well defined sql error. Investigating on the problem I see that the ""oracle.ddl"" file contains a ""tablespace"" variable that is replaced only by the OracleDatabaseJournal implementation.

As a workaround users can create a different ddl without a tablespace variable, but this should probably work better out of the box.

WDYT about one of the following solutions?
- make the base DatabaseJournal implementation support jndi datasource just like PersistenceManagers do (without a specific configuration property but specifying a jndi location in the url property)
- move the replacement of the tablespace variable (and maybe: add a generic replacement of *any* parameter found in the databaseJournal configuration) to the main DatabaseJournal implementation. This could be handy and it will make the OracleDatabaseJournal extension useless, but I see that at the moment there can be a problem with the MsSql implementation, since it adds ""on "" to the tablespace name only when it's not set to an empty string.

1,"recovery tool does not recover when version history can be instantiated, but root version can notJCR-2551 introduced a recovery mode which tries to instantiate the version history, and if this fails, disconnects the VH (version history) and makes the node unversioned.

However, it appears it can happen that the persistence is damaged such as getting the VH does indeed work, but subsequent operations fail due to other problems. One problem that has been seen is a missing frozenNode property of the root version (or a missing frozenNode itself).

As a quick fix, we may want to change the checker so that it actually also tries to get the rootVersion and it's frozenNode. Long term, depending on how frequent this problem is, we may have to think about a less drastic recovery than disconnecting the VH."

1,"Clustering: race condition may cause duplicate entries in search indexThere seems to be a race condition that may cause duplicate search index entries. It is reproducible as follows (Jackrabbit 1.3):

2) Shutdown clusternode 1.
3) Start clusternode 2 with an empty search index.
4) Execute the query  //element(*, clustering:test).
4) Print the result of the query (UUIDs of nodes in the result set).

When I just run clusternode 2, then there is one node in the resultset, as expected. However, when I debug clusternode 2 and have a breakpoint (i.e., a pause of a few seconds at line 306 of RepositoryImpl.java - just before the clusternode is started), then the resultset contains two results, both with the same UUID.

Proposals:

- drop JDK 1.4 support
- tune the JCR2SPI handler to create namespace attributes when needed
- use an entirely different serializer

1,"Deadlock in DefaultISMLockingThere seems to be a bug in DefaultISMLocking which was detected as part of JCR-2746.

1) The main thread gets a read lock.

2) The ObservationManager thread tries to lock for writing, which is blocked because there is still a read lock.

3) Then the main thread tries to get a second read lock, which is blocked because there is a waiting write lock.

The bug was introduced as part of JCR-2089 (Use java.util.concurrent), revisions 995411 and 995412. I think the safe solution is to revert those to commits, and add a test case. If the DefaultISMLocking is changed later on, more test cases are required. An efficient solution is relatively complicated.

1,"A failure to connect to a MySQL database when JackRabbit starts a session leaves a .lock file in the repository. Subsequent sessions cannot be created by the same thread.I investigating the robustness of JackRabbit in the face of unexpected database errors, such as the database being unavailable. In my particular case, I am attempting to start a JackRabbit session using a TransientRepository while the database is not yet running. This correctly fails. However, if I attempt to create another session within the same thread after a short while, an exception occurs saying that the repository has already been locked. I would expect the repository folder not to be locked. Maybe the code meant to remove the .lock file was not triggered because of an uncaught exception.

InternalValue.createCopy checks USE_DATA_STORE and returns the same value for the source node's state. BundleBinding.writeState() calls BLOBInMemory.discard() when persisting the new node. This has now changed the value of the existing nodes property. Setting the option org.jackrabbit.useDataStore to false works fine. Possibly the check for binary property type in InternalValue.createCopy should be done first?"

was related to the allow-only for groups).

anyway:
while playing around with the permission in our CRX recently i found, that the evaluation of the following setup didn't work as I would
have expected:

- user A is member of group B and C
- for both groups an ACE exists on a given node /a/b/c
- the acl looks like  { deny for B, allow for C }

I would have expected that the allow for C would have reverted the previous deny for B since - in the GUI - I read the ace eval order from first entry to last entry... in the order I added them."

1,"DatabaseJournal improperly finds tables in external schemas when used on OracleThe DatabaseJournal currently calls database metadata to determine if the journal table has already been created.  It uses the following code to do so:

The Oracle driver sometimes will return the table if it is in another schema on the same database.  Other DBMS code within JackRabbit has a specific Oracle version that handles this case.  In order for the journal table to be properly created, Oracle databases will need the schema name included in the getTables() call."

1,"TransientRepository with LocalFileSystem eventually causes Repository data to be stored at path '/'I'm using a TransitoryRepository for my unit testing, with the repository's file system specified as:

    <FileSystem class=""org.apache.jackrabbit.core.fs.local.LocalFileSystem"">
        <param name=""path"" value=""${rep.home}/repository""/>
    </FileSystem>

I noticed today that when I run my unit tests Jackrabbit is creating four directories at the root of my hard drive: ""meta"", ""namespaces"", ""nodetypes"", and ""data"". I tracked the problem the fact that when a LocalFileSystem is closed, it sets the ""root"" to null - an invalid state. But when using a TransitoryRepository, the invalid state is never discovered because the LocalFileSystem object itself is not released, or re-initialized. It is simply used to create BasedFileSystem objects in RepositoryImpl. Calls to BasedFileSystem defer to the LocalFileSystem object that now has a null root. Inside the LocalFileSystem, all the calls to Java's io.File constructor have a ""null"" parent parameter, causing File to fall back to its single argument constructor which sees the path ""/meta"" and happily creates files at the root of the disk.

I'm not sure what the best solution is, but some thoughts I've had are:
- don't set the ""root"" property to null when closing a LocalFileSystem
- make RepositoryConfig re-init the FileSystem variable when it is accessed.
- don't cache the RepositoryConfig in TransitoryRepository (this might also require a new constructor that takes a class-path resource for the repository configuration file)"

1,"Check for correct content-type in URLEncodedUtils not working for encoding-suffixesDear DEV-Team,

i am developing an application with the httpclient. Today i found a small problem, related to URLEncodedUtils.

Our Tomcat-Server deliveres for Server-Requests, the HTTP-Header: ""Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded;charset=UTF-8"", but the httpclient only checks for: ""Content-Type=application/x-www-form-urlencoded"". This failing check results in an empty result of call to the method: URLEncodedUtils.parse(entity);

Following source-code causes the prob: 

public class URLEncodedUtils {

    /**
     * Returns true if the entity's Content-Type header is
     * <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.
     */
    public static boolean isEncoded (final HttpEntity entity) {
        final Header contentType = entity.getContentType();
        return (contentType != null && contentType.getValue().equalsIgnoreCase(CONTENT_TYPE));
    }
}

IMO the method should be changed to:


public class URLEncodedUtils {

    /**
     * Returns true if the entity's Content-Type header is
     * <code>application/x-www-form-urlencoded</code>.
     */
    public static boolean isEncoded (final HttpEntity entity) {
        final Header contentType = entity.getContentType();
        return (contentType != null && contentType.getValue().startsWith(CONTENT_TYPE + "";""));
    }
}

1,"DateUtil#formatDate uses default locale instead of USProblem reported by Yannick <yannick at meudal.net> on the httpclient-user list

==================================================================
Hello,

This is a bug report.

I'm using Commons HTTPClient (rc2) for generating HTTP requests. I put in 
headers some specific header, like the If-Modified-Since attribute. 
When I generate the date through DateUtil.formatDate method, I get a 
localized date, in french. Example: 
If-Modified-Since: dim., 10 avr. 2005 05:04:08 CEST

I get problems on my http server during parsing the received date. This is 
not a RFC 2616 compliant date format. It should be:
If-Modified-Since: Sun, 10 Apr 2005 05:04:08 CEST

A patch should be applied, by creating a new SimpleDateFormat(pattern, 
Locale.US) instead of SimpleDateFormat(pattern) (like it is done in the 
parse method, line #159).

org.apache.commons.httpclient.util.DateUtil, line #205:

    public static String formatDate(Date date, String pattern) {
        if (date == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException(""date is 
null"");
        if (pattern == null) throw new IllegalArgumentException(""pattern 
is null"");
 
        SimpleDateFormat formatter = new SimpleDateFormat(pattern, 
Locale.US);
        return formatter.format(date);
    }


Regards,

Yannick."
1,"String properties with invalid XML characters export as invalid XMLAs noted in the current JCR 1.0.1 maintenance draft, sections 6.4.1,
6.4.2.6, XML export of string properties that contain invalid XML
characters isn't well-defined currently, since those characters are
not permissible in XML.  The proposed fix is to use base64
encoding for such values in System View.

Most characters below #x20 are examples of this.  Currently, these
are escaped numerically in output (such as (amp)#0; )  but
such escape sequences can't be parsed by the XML
import methods.

The current behavior is particularly problematic, because the user
doesn't know the output is corrupt until later, when they try to import it
and get InvalidSerializedDataException.

If for some reason the base64 option is delayed, it might
make sense, as an interim solution, to fail on export
or to somehow patch import to relax its parsing and allow
these escape codes."

1,"BasicCookieStore treats cookies of the same name from the same host as duplicates, even if they have different pathsThe DefaultHttpClient is not handling cookies correctly when a single host returns multiple cookies of the same name but with separate paths.  For example, if a single instance of the client is used to access two different webapps on the same server, it may receive two different JSESSIONID cookies:

Cookie: [version: 0][name: JSESSIONID][value: F832C01D23F501CE5EEB296B602700C1][domain: lglom139.example.com][path: /msa-adrenalina][expiry: null]

Because the CookieIdentityComparator class does not test the cookie path when determining equality, each new JSESSIONID received replaces the previous one instead of adding a new cookie to the store.  This results in ""disconnecting"" the client from its sessions on the prior webapps.

I've confirmed that adding a path test to CookieIdentityComparator resolves this problem."
1,"Enabling wire logging changes isEof/isStale behaviorIf you enable wire logging, DefaultClientConnection wraps the SocketInputBuffer with a LoggingSessionInputBuffer. This hides the EofSensor interface implemented by SocketInputBuffer (but not LoggingSessionInputBuffer), which makes at least AbstractHttpClientConnection.isEof() and isStale() methods behave differently.

(That is, stale connection checks won't really work as intended if wire logging is enabled. Which makes it a bit difficult to debug problems related to stale connections...)

Proposed fix: implement EofSensor interface in LoggingSessionInputBuffer (delegating it to wrapped buffer).

1,"MultiReader does not propagate readerFinishedListeners to clones/reopened readersWhile working on refactoring MultiReader/DirectoryReader in trunk, I found out that MultiReader does not correctly pass readerFinishedListeners to its clones and reopened readers."
1,"IndexReader.open(String|File) may incorrectly throw AlreadyClosedExceptionSpinoff from here:

    http://www.nabble.com/Runtime-exception-when-creating-IndexSearcher-to20226279.html

If you open an IndexSearcher/Reader, passing in String or File, then
closeDirectory is set to true in the reader.

If the index has a single segment, then SegmentReader.get is used to
open the index.  If an IOException is hit in there, the SegmentReader
closes itself and then closes the directory since closeDirectory is
true.

The problem is, the retry logic in SegmentInfos (to look for another
segments_N to try) kicks in and hits an AlreadyClosedException,
masking the original root cause.

Workaround is to separately get the Directory using
FSDirectory.getDirectory, and then instantiate IndexSearcher/Reader
from that.

This manifests as masking the root cause of a corrupted single-segment
index with a confusing AlreadyClosedException.  You could also hit
the false exception if the writer was in the process of committing
(ie, a retry was really needed) or if there is some transient IO
problem opening the index (eg too many open files).

1,"Incorrect sort by Numeric values for documents missing the sorting fieldWhile sorting results over a numeric field, documents which do not contain a value for the sorting field seem to get 0 (ZERO) value in the sort. (Tested against Double, Float, Int & Long numeric fields ascending and descending order).
This behavior is unexpected, as zero is ""comparable"" to the rest of the values. A better solution would either be allowing the user to define such a ""non-value"" default, or always bring those document results as the last ones.

Example scenario:
Adding 3 documents, 1st with value 3.5d, 2nd with -10d, and 3rd without any value.
Searching with MatchAllDocsQuery, with sort over that field in descending order yields the docid results of 0, 2, 1.

Asking for the top 2 documents brings the document without any value as the 2nd result - which seems as a bug?"
1,"Using MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher can change the sort order.When using multiple sort criteria the first criterium that indicates a difference should be used.
When a field does not exist for a given document, special rules apply.
From what I see in the code, it is sorted as 0 for integer and float fields, and null Strings are sorted before others.

This works correctly in both Lucene 1.4.3 and in trunk as long as you use a single IndexSearcher (except perhaps in special cases, see other bug reports like LUCENE-374).

However, in MultiSearcher and ParallelMultiSearcher, the results of the separate IndexSearchers are merged and there an error occurs.
The bug is located in FieldDocSortedHitQueue.

It can even be demonstrated by passing a single indexSearcher to a MultiSearcher.

TestCase and patch follow."

1,"AccessManager + CachingHierarchyManager problemThe problem we have is the implementation of the CachingHierarchyManager,
to which the SimpleAccessManager holds a reference.

Let's consider following example:
i add 3 subnodes (a,b,c) to a node and after that i reorder b and c ..
so i have a,c,b. in the process of reordering (using the function
orderBefore of javax.jcr.Node) our AccessManager is called several times to check the permissions of the nodes. In this AccessManager we use some
functions of the CachingHierarchyManager, f.ex.

Path itemPath = hierMgr.getPath(id);
return itemPath.denotesRoot();

or

Path itemPath = hierMgr.getPath(itemId);
Path parentPath = itemPath.getAncestor(1);
return hierMgr.resolvePath(parentPath);

the problem is, that when calling the methods of the
CachingHierarchyManager the nodes i ask for will be cached in the idCache in a wrong state (i. e.: before actually reordering the elements).
so if i want f.ex. delete the node b after reordering, the node will
be looked up in the idCache. in the cache the index of node b is still 2
(actually it should be 3) and so the wrong node will be deleted! "
1,"IndexWriter does not release its write lock when trying to open an index which does not yet existIn version 2.0.0, the private IndexWriter constructor does not properly remove its write lock in the event of an error. This can be seen when one attempts to open (not create) an index in a directory which exists, but in which there is no segments file. Here is the offending code:

    247   private IndexWriter(Directory d, Analyzer a, final boolean create, boolean closeDir)
    248     throws IOException {
    249       this.closeDir = closeDir;
    250       directory = d;
    251       analyzer = a;
    252 
    253       Lock writeLock = directory.makeLock(IndexWriter.WRITE_LOCK_NAME);
    254       if (!writeLock.obtain(writeLockTimeout)) // obtain write lock
    255         throw new IOException(""Index locked for write: "" + writeLock);
    256       this.writeLock = writeLock;                   // save it
    257 
    258       synchronized (directory) {        // in- & inter-process sync
    259         new Lock.With(directory.makeLock(IndexWriter.COMMIT_LOCK_NAME), commitLockTimeout) {
    260             public Object doBody() throws IOException {
    261               if (create)
    262                 segmentInfos.write(directory);
    263               else
    264                 segmentInfos.read(directory);
    265               return null;
    266             }
    267           }.run();
    268       }
    269   }

On line 254, a write lock is obtained by the constructor. If an exception is raised inside the doBody() method (on line 260), then that exception is propagated, the constructor will fail, but the lock is not released until the object is garbage collected. This is typically an issue except when using the IndexModifier class.

As of the filing of this bug, this has not yet been fixed in the trunk (IndexWriter.java#472959):

    251   private IndexWriter(Directory d, Analyzer a, final boolean create, boolean closeDir)
    252     throws IOException {
    253       this.closeDir = closeDir;
    254       directory = d;
    255       analyzer = a;
    256 
    257       Lock writeLock = directory.makeLock(IndexWriter.WRITE_LOCK_NAME);
    258       if (!writeLock.obtain(writeLockTimeout)) // obtain write lock
    259         throw new IOException(""Index locked for write: "" + writeLock);
    260       this.writeLock = writeLock;                   // save it
    261 
    262       synchronized (directory) {        // in- & inter-process sync
    263         new Lock.With(directory.makeLock(IndexWriter.COMMIT_LOCK_NAME), commitLockTimeout) {
    264             public Object doBody() throws IOException {
    265               if (create)
    266                 segmentInfos.write(directory);
    267               else
    268                 segmentInfos.read(directory);
    269               return null;
    270             }
    271           }.run();

1,"JCR2SPI: potential race condition in event listener registrationThere's a potential race condition when the first event listener is registered (ObservationManager.addEventListener). The observation manager should only start listening for events after the new SPI event filter has been created.

1,"CVE-2009-0026: Cross site scripting issues in webappSome of the jackrabbit-webapp forms don't properly escape user input when displaying it in the resulting HTML page. This leads to potential cross site scripting issues. For example:

The CVE id for this issue is CVE-2009-0026. This issue was reported by the Red Hat Security Response Team."
1,"CacheBehaviour Observation brokenWhile trying to fix JCR-2293 I discovered that CacheBehaviour Observation is broken:

- HierarchyEventListener.onEvent ignores local event (despite the comment saying otherwise). Not sure which way it should be. However with local events being ignored, JCR-2293 will most probably also occur with CacheBehaviour Observation. 

- NodeEntryImpl.refresh(Event) does not set its child node entries to incomplete when a node/property was added.

- After tentatively fixing above issues, I discovered that NodeEntryImpl.refresh(Event) and my own event listener operate on different NodeEntryImpl and ChildNodeEntryImpl instances. That is, even though I set childNodeEntries.complete to false in NodeEntryImpl.refresh(Event), when my own event listener retrieves that node (entry), it gets a different instance which has childNodeEntries.complete still set to true.
"
1,"jcr-server should respect child node definition of jcr:contentWhen creating a new file, jcr:content defaults to nt:unstructured. This causes file creation to fail when the underlying persistent store (i.e. SPI implementation) does not support nt:unstructured for jcr:content. 

I suggest to check whether the underlying implementation provides its own node type for jcr:content and use that one. If not, default to nt:unstructured."
1,"ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in NodeTypeDefDiffIt appears that the code for building diffs in child node definitions loops incorrectly, opening the possibility for an ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception. The offending portion is in the ""buildChildNodeDefDiffs"" method:

<<
NodeDef[] cnda2 = newDef.getChildNodeDefs();
HashMap defs2 = new HashMap();
for (int i = 0; i < cnda1.length; i++) {
    defs2.put(cnda2[i].getId(), cnda2[i]);
}
>>

It seems like simply changing the length check to be cnda2 (as it is in ""buildPropDefsDiff"") would suffice."

1,"derelativizing of relative URIs with a scheme is incorrectURI constructor ""public URI(URI base, URI relative) throws URIException"" assumes that if given 'relative' URI has a scheme, it should provide an authority and complete path to the constructed URI.

Demonstration code:

URI base = new URI(""http://www.example.com/some/page"");
URI rel = new URI(""http:boo"");
URI derel = new URI(base,rel);
derel.toString();
(java.lang.String) http:boo

In fact, derel should be ""http://www.example.com/some/boo"". 

RFC2396 is a little confused about this; section 3.1 states """"Relative URI references are distinguished from absolute URI in that they do not begin with a scheme name."" But, in section 5, there are several sentences talking about relative URIs that begin with schemes (and how this prevents using relative URIs that have leading path segments that look like scheme identifiers). 

RFC3896, which supercedes RFC2396, removes the implication a relative URI cannot begin with a scheme, leaving the other text explcitly discussing relative URIs with schemes. 

Both Firefox (1.5) and IE (6.0) treat ""http:boo"" the same as ""boo"" for purposes of derelativization against an HTTP base URI, which would give the final URI ""http://www.example.com/some/boo"" in the example above. 

Even relative URIs like ""http:../../boo"" are explicitly legal. 

"
1,"PUT method blocks against older serversTo reproduce, attempt a PUT request against an appropriate servlet under TC3.2
(yes I know that needs an upgrade - sigh)

RFC 2616 says:
""Because of the presence of older implementations, the protocol allows ambiguous
situations in which a client may send ""Expect: 100- continue"" without receiving
either a 417 (Expectation Failed) status or a 100 (Continue) status. Therefore,
when a client sends this header field to an origin server (possibly via a proxy)
from which it has never seen a 100 (Continue) status, the client SHOULD NOT wait
for an indefinite period before sending the request body.""

This isn't how HttpClient behaves. After sending the headers,
PutMethod.writeRequestBody() returns false. HttpMethodBase then calls
readStatusCode(), which blocks waiting for a read (or I guess you could time out
the whole request). Right now this makes it impossible to use HttpClient to PUT
to older Http 1.1 implementations.

A suggested resolution: since the spec allows for clients to avoid waiting if
they know the 100 response will not arrive, why not simply provide a boolean
flag to allow the 'wait for 100' behaviour in PutMethod.writeResponseBody() to
be turned off, on a per-request basis? This solution puts the burden of knowing
""origin server[s]...from which it has never seen a 100 (Continue) status"" on the
user of HttpClient. Less than perfect as you can only find out that this has
happened by trial and error.

A more correct solution, is to maintain a list of servers that ignore the Expect
header in PutMethod, and override PutMethod.readStatusCode() to time out, send
the body, remember this server is buggy, and read the status code again."

1,"HTTPS Post Does Not WorkUsing Java 1.4.1_01 on Windows 2000. An HTTPS Post results in HTTP/100-Continue

1,"TimeLimitingCollector's TimeExceededException contains useless relative docidWe found another bug with the RandomIndexWriter: When TimeLimitingCollector breaks collection after timeout, it records the last/next collected docid. It does this without rebasing, so the docid is useless. TestTimeLimitingCollector checks the docid, but correctly rebases it (as only this makes sense). Because the RandomIndexWriter uses different merge settings, the index is now sometimes not optimized and so the test fails (which is correct, as the docid is useless for non-optimized index).

Attached is a patch that fixes this. Please tell me if I should backport to 2.9 and 3.0!"
1,"javax.jcr.RepositoryException when a JOIN SQL2 query is send via Davex and has resultssee the following thread for details:
http://www.mail-archive.com/users@jackrabbit.apache.org/msg17975.html

assuming a data structure as follows:
/foo [nt:unstructured]
/foo/bar [nt:unstructured]
/foo/bar@lala = huii (lala is string property of bar)
/ding [nt:unstructured]
/ding@dong = ##barUUID### (dong is a property of type ""Reference"")

then the following code will throw an exception:

DavexClient Client = new DavexClient(url);
Repository repo = Client.getRepository();
Credentials sc = new SimpleCredentials(""admin"",""admin"".toCharArray());
Session s = repo.login(sc,workspace);

QueryManager qm = s.getWorkspace().getQueryManager();

String sql = ""SELECT data.* FROM [nt:unstructured] AS data WHERE data.lala= 'huii'"";
sql = ""SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] AS data INNER JOIN [nt:unstructured] AS referring ON referring.[dong] = data.[jcr:uuid] WHERE data.lala = 'huii'"";
sql = ""SELECT * FROM [nt:unstructured] AS data INNER JOIN [nt:unstructured] AS referring ON ISDESCENDANTNODE(data, referring) WHERE data.lala = 'huii'"";
Query query = qm.createQuery(sql, Query.JCR_SQL2);
QueryResult qr = query.execute();

The first query works just fine and I can iterate over the result. Neither the second nor the third query works.
In both cases I end up with a javax.jcr.RepositoryException. Note the exception only happens if the query returns results. Aka a join will work just fine if it matches no rows."
1,"need to ensure that sims that use collection-level stats (e.g. sumTotalTermFreq) handle non-existent fieldBecause of things like queryNorm, unfortunately similarities have to handle the case where they are asked to computeStats() for a term, where the field does not exist at all.
(Note they will never have to actually score anything, but unless we break how queryNorm works for TFIDF, we have to deal with this case).

I noticed this while doing some benchmarking, so i created a test to test some cases like this across all the sims."

1,"IW.optimize() can do too many merges at the very endThis was fixed on trunk in LUCENE-1044 but I'd like to separately
backport it to 2.3.

With ConcurrentMergeScheduler there is a bug, only when CFS is on,
whereby after the final merge of an optimize has finished and while
it's building its CFS, the merge policy may incorrectly ask for
another merge to collapse that segment into a compound file.  The net
effect is optimize can spend many extra iterations unecessarily
merging a single segment to collapse it to compound file.

I believe the case is rare (hard to hit), and maybe only if you have
multiple threads calling optimize at once (the TestThreadedOptimize
test can hit it), but it's a low-risk fix so I plan to commit to 2.3
shortly.

1,"ExportSysViewTest fails with: System property org.xml.sax.driver not specifiedThe ExportSysViewTest class uses the XMLReaderFactory.createXMLReader() method that depends on the system property ""org.xml.sax.driver"" being specified. Apparently using a TransformerFactory works around this issue in some way, as the problem only appeared once we changed the XML export feature to use a custom serializer class instead of a JAXP Transformer for serialization (see JCR-1952).

The current workaround is to explicitly force a Transformer to be loaded, but we really should fix the cause of this issue for example by replacing the XMLReader instance with a SAXParser."
1,"when opening the merged SegmentReader, IW attempts to open store files that were deletedThe issue happens when a merge runs that does not merge the doc stores, those doc stores are still being written to, IW is using CFS, and while the merge is running the doc stores get closed and turned into a cfx file.

When we then try to open the reader (for warming), which as of LUCENE-2311 will now [correctly] open the doc stores, we hit FNFE because the SegmentInfo for the merge does not realize that the doc stores were turned into  a cfx.

This issue does affect trunk; if you crank up the #docs in the test, it happens consistently (I will tie this to _TestUtil.getRandomMultiplier!)."

Grant: my take on this is that SpellChecker.clearIndex is in the wrong. it shouldn't be calling unlock unless it has reason to think there is a ""stale lock"" that needs to be closed - ie: this is a bug in SpellChecker that you have only discovered because this bug LUCENE-1050 was fixed.

I would suggest a new issue for tracking, and a patch in which SpellChecker.clearIndex doesn't call unlock unless isLocked returns true. Even then, it might make sense to catch and ignore LockReleaseFailedException and let whatever resulting exception may originate from ""new IndexWriter"" be returned.

1,"Problems with custom nodes in journalI have an application that uses custom node types and I am having problems in a clustered configuration.

Issue 1: the following definition in a nodetype is incorrectly read from the journal:
  + * (nt:hierarchyNode) version

The * is stored in the journal as _x002a_ since it should be a QName and it gets escaped.
When read, the code ...core.nodetype.compact.CompactNodeTypeDefReader.doChildNodeDefinition does the following test:

        if (currentTokenEquals('*')) {
            ndi.setName(ItemDef.ANY_NAME); 
        } else {
            ndi.setName(toQName(currentToken));
        }

Since currentToken is _x002a_ and not * toQName(currentToken) is called but it fails.
I changed the test to:
        if (currentTokenEquals('*') || currentTokenEquals(""_x002a_""))
            ....
and that fixes the problem.

Issue 2: when storing a nodeType in the journal the superclass nt:base is not store, but when reading I get an error saying the node should be a subclass of nt:base.

The code in...core.nodetype.compact.CompactNodeTypeDefWriter.writeSupertypes skips nt:base when writing the node.

When reading the nodetype definition from the journal the following exception is thrown:

Unable to deliver node type operation: [{http://namespace/app/repository/1.0}resource] all primary node types except nt:base itself must be (directly or indirectly) derived from nt:base

probably because nt:base is not re-added to the nodetype definition

1,"HttpClient does not compile 'out of the box' in IBM's VisualAge IDEThis was observed with IBM VisualAge 3.5, which runs JDK1.2.2:

Importing the HTTPClient source code into the IDE brings up a
compilation error in 

org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase.

The initialization of ""private ResponseConsumedWatcher m_responseWatcher""
using an anyonymous inner class seems to cause some trouble. Implicated code:

private ResponseConsumedWatcher m_responseWatcher = new ResponseConsumedWatcher
() {
	public void responseConsumed() {
		responseBodyConsumed();
	}
};

The error message is: ""Field initialization: The constructor invoked to create
org.apache.commons.httpclient.HttpMethodBase$1 with arguments () is not defined""

...but only in the context of HttpMethodBase(String uri) constructor, i.e.
the HttpMethodBase() constructor *can* be compiled, HttpMethodBase(String uri)
*cannot* be compiled with error ""Cannot create constructor due to incorrect
field initialization"".

I interpret this to mean that the compiler is looking for a parameterless
constructor for the anonymous class in the context of 
HttpMethodBase(String uri). The message did not really make sense to me. 
Checked the syntax, checked in the Language Definition whether setting up an
anonymous class like that is permitted; found nothing obviously wrong.

Fix:

The code above is equivalent to constructing the instance at the beginning
of each constructor of the enclosing class. A copy and paste of the
construction code into each of the two constructors fixes things...until
the next update."

1,"SpellChecker does not work properly on calling indexDictionary after clearIndexWe have to call clearIndex and indexDictionary to rebuild dictionary from fresh. The call to SpellChecker clearIndex() function does not reset the searcher. Hence, when we call indexDictionary after that, many entries that are already in the stale searcher will not be indexed.

Also, I see that IndexReader reader is used for the sole purpose of obtaining the docFreq of a given term in exist() function. This functionality can also be obtained by using just the searcher by calling searcher.docFreq. Thus, can we get away completely with reader and code associated with it like
      if (IndexReader.isLocked(spellIndex)){
	IndexReader.unlock(spellIndex);
      }
and the reader related code in finalize?

The error seems to be caused by the fact that ReportTask uses the OP (operation) column for the String, but then uses the length of the algorithm declaration to index into the String, resulting in the index out of bounds exception.

The line in question is:
return (s + padd).substring(0, col.length());

And probably should be changed to something like:
    String s1 = (s + padd);
    return s1.substring(0, Math.min(col.length(), s1.length()));

Either that or the column should be trimmed.  The workaround is to explicitly name the task.

If no objections, I will make the change, tomorrow.  "
1,"Version.isSame(Object) not workingVersion interface is implemented (on the frontend) by the VersionImpl class (extending NodeWrapper), which delegates to an internal NodeImpl class, which in turn extends ItemImpl.

Say you have :
      Node node = // at Version 1.0
      Version version = // retrieved as 1.0 for the node
      Version baseVersion = node.getBaseVersion()

You now expect
      baseVersion.isSame(version)
even if
      baseVersion != version

This fails, because VersionImpl delegates the isSame call to its delegatee, thus above call becomes
      ((VersionImpl) baseVersion).delegatee.isSame(version)
where this method is implemented by the ItemImpl class from which the delegatee NodeImpl extends.

That latter implementation ItemImpl.isSame() only returns true if the other is an ItemImpl, too. But this is not the case because VersionImpl is a Version, NodeWrapper, Node but not an ItemImpl.

Probably the best solution would be for NodeImpl.isSame() to check whether the otherItem is a NodeWrapper und use ((NodeWrapper) otherItem).delegatee as the otherItem for the delegatee call.

On another track: ItemImpl.isSame() should probably do a fast check whether the otherItem is actually the same instance to prevent type checks..."

1,"IndexWriter.synced  field accumulates data leading to a Memory LeakI am running into a strange OutOfMemoryError. My small test application does
index and delete some few files. This is repeated for 60k times. Optimization
is run from every 2k times a file is indexed. Index size is 50KB. I did analyze
the HeapDumpFile and realized that IndexWriter.synced field occupied more than
half of the heap. That field is a private HashSet without a getter. Its task is
to hold files which have been synced already.

There are two calls to addAll and one call to add on synced but no remove or
clear throughout the lifecycle of the IndexWriter instance.

According to the Eclipse Memory Analyzer synced contains 32618 entries which
look like file names ""_e065_1.del"" or ""_e067.cfs""

The index directory contains 10 files only.

I guess synced is holding obsolete data "
1,"Yet another race in IW#nrtIsCurrentIn IW#nrtIsCurrent looks like this:

  synchronized boolean nrtIsCurrent(SegmentInfos infos) {
    ensureOpen();
    return infos.version == segmentInfos.version && !docWriter.anyChanges() && !bufferedDeletesStream.any();
  }
{code}

* the version changes once we checkpoint the IW
* docWriter has changes if there are any docs in ram or any deletes in the delQueue
* bufferedDeletes contain all frozen del packages from the delQueue

yet, what happens is 1. we decrement the numDocsInRam in DWPT#doAfterFlush (which is executed during DWPT#flush) but before we checkpoint. 2. if we freeze deletes (empty the delQueue) we put them in the flushQueue to maintain the order.  This means they are not yet in the bufferedDeleteStream.

Bottom line, there is a window where we could see IW#nrtIsCurrent returning true if we check within this particular window. Phew, I am not 100% sure if that is the reason for our latest failure in SOLR-2861 but from what the logs look like this could be what happens. If we randomly hit low values for maxBufferedDocs & maxBufferedDeleteTerms this is absolutely possible."
